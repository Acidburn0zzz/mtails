# We set UDISKS_IGNORE on TailsData partitions to hide them in GNOME apps.
# This solves two issues:
#  * It hides TailsData in the Places menu, which, when clicked, would show
#    an error because it is already mounted.
#    See 791cab4b6f075ee9753cac08895acb2f008a7e71.
#    XXX: This commit is very old, let's check if we would still be affected
#         by this issue if we don't hide the partition.
#
#  * It prevents spurious notifications being shown when setting up persistence.
