2009 06 20 - dev

	* hardware support:
	- install firmware-linux from backports.org
	- install system-config-printer
	* APT/pinning: give backports.org priority 200, so that we track
	upgrades of packages installed from there.
	* build system: allow building several images at once

2009 06 19 - dev

	* Tor: added a "Restart Tor" launcher to the Gnome panel,
	that runs "/etc/init.d/tor restart"
	* APT: re-configure pinning and sources to use squeeze rather than
	unstable to fetch newer or not-in-Lenny software
	* hardware support: added instructions in README.eCAFE to support the
	Hercules eCAFÉ™ EC-800 netbook
	* release: include the Changelog and TODO in the generated images,
	in the 	/usr/share/doc/amnesia/ directory
	* torbutton: install newer version from Squeeze

2009 06 18 - dev

	* software: install gnomebaker when building Gnome-based live OS, to
	easily clone myself when running from CD

2009 06 17 - dev

	* Tor vs. Network Manager: added a restart tor hook to if-up.d (used by
	Network Manager as well), so that Tor does work immediately even if
	the network cable was plugged late in/after the boot process
	* build system cleanup
	- migrated most of lh_config invocations to scripts/config
	- append "noprompt" so that halting/rebooting work with splashy
	- moved our own variables to config/amnesia, using the namespace
	  $AMNESIA_*
	* APT: configure pinning to support installing chosen packages from sid;
	the APT source for unstable is hardcoded in chroot_sources/sid, since
	there is no way to use $LH_CHROOT_MIRROR there: the chroot_local-hooks
	have no access to such configuration variables :/
	* iceweasel: install NoScript plugin from Debian sid

2009 06 16 - dev

	* iceweasel: delete urlclassifier3.sqlite on $HOME refresh: as we
	  disabled "safebrowsing", this huge file is of no use
	* build system
	- rely on standard live-initramfs adduser to do our user setup
	  (including sudo vs. Gnome/KDE, etc.)
	- stop "supporting" KDE
	* linux: removed non-686 kernel flavours when building i386 images
	* compatibility: append "live-media=removable live-media-timeout=15", to
	  prevent blindly booting another debian-live installed on the hard disk
	* software: install scribus

2009 XX XX - dev

	* Forked Privatix 9.03.15, by Markus Mandalka:
	http://mandalka.name/privatix/index.html.en
	Everything has since been rewritten or so heavily changed that nothing
	remains from the original code... apart of a bunch of Gnome settings.
	* iceweasel
	- default search engine is now Scroogle SSL, configured to search pages
	  in French language; the English one is also installed
	- never ask to save passwords or forms content
	- configured the torbutton extension to use polipo
	- installed the CACert root certificate
	- installed the SSL Blacklist extension and the blacklist data
	- installed the FireGPG extension
	- installed the CS Lite extension
	- installed the NoScript extension
	- NoScript, CS Lite: replaced the default whitelists with a list of
	  trusted, non-commercial Internet Service Providers
	- configure extensions (add to prefs.js):
		user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup", true);
		user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup_state", 1);
		user_pref("extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled", true);
		user_pref("noscript.notify.hide", true);
		user_pref("capability.policy.maonoscript.sites", "about:
			about:blank about:certerror about:config about:credits
			about:neterror about:plugins about:privatebrowsing
			about:sessionrestore chrome: resource:");
		user_pref("extensions.firegpg.no_updates", true);
	* Tor
	- enable the transparent proxy, the DNS resolver, and the control port
	- save authentication cookie to /tmp/control_auth_cookie, so that the
	  live user can use Tork and co.
	- autostart Tork with Gnome
	- Tork: installed, disabled most notifications and startup tips
	* build system
	- build i386 images when the build host is amd64
	- added a version file: /etc/amnesia/version
	- use snapshot live-* packages inside the images
	- setup timezone depending on the chosen build locale
	* $HOME
	- added a nautilus-script to wipe files and directories
	- bash with working completion for the live user
	* software: added
	- gnome-app-install
	- iwconfig
	- cryptkeeper: Gnome system tray applet to encrypt files with EncFS
	- kvkbd: virtual keyboard (installed from backports.org)
	- sshfs (and added live user to the fuse group)
	- less, secure-delete, wipe, seahorse, sshfs, ntfs-3g
	* polipo: install and configure this HTTP proxy to forward requests
	through Tor
	* DNS: install and configure pdnsd to forward any DNS request through
	the Tor resolver
	* firewall: force every outgoing TCP connection through the Tor
	transparent proxy, discard any outgoing UDP connection
	* hardware support
	- install a bunch of non-free wifi firmwares
	- install xsane and add the live user to the scanner group
