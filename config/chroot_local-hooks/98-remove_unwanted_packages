echo "Removing unwanted packages"

### Deinstall dev packages.

# We use apt-get as aptitude doesn't know about globs.
# There are packages we could be tempted to remove but we can't:
#   - gcc-*-base (libstdc++6 depends on it)
#   - libgcc1 (apt depends on it)
#   - cpp, cpp-* (big parts of GNOME depend on it)

### Deinstall a few unwanted packages that were pulled by tasksel
### since they have Priority: standard.
apt-get --yes purge  \
   m4 \
   mlocate \
   nfs-common \
   texinfo

### Deinstall a few unwanted packages that were pulled by the xorg
### metapackage.

### We'll remove packages listed in this variable. It's purpose is to
### gather *several* packages we might want to remove below and purge
### then at the same time, which has less overhead than purging them
### one at a time.
packages_to_purge=""

### Remove packages that can get a different priority in the security
### archive (see https://bugs.debian.org/867668):
for package in mutt rpcbind tcpd ; do
    if is_package_installed "$package"; then
        packages_to_purge="${packages_to_purge} ${package}"
    fi
done

### Hotfix for 3.14: procmail is no longer known by apt in tagged
### snapshots, likely because no longer pulled by monkeysphere:
if is_package_installed procmail; then
    packages_to_purge="${packages_to_purge} procmail"
fi

### Hotfix for 4.0~beta1: similar as for procmail, above.
for p in gcc-6 gcc-7 libgcc-7-dev; do
    if is_package_installed "${p}"; then
        packages_to_purge="${packages_to_purge} ${p}"
    fi
done

if [ -n "${packages_to_purge}" ]; then
    apt-get --yes purge "${packages_to_purge}"

### Deinstall some other unwanted packages.
apt-get --yes purge  \
    '^aptitude*' \
    libdvdcss2-dbgsym \
    live-build \
    tasksel \
    tasksel-data

### Deinstall some other unwanted packages whose regexp might not be match
### anything when building with partial, tagged APT snapshots.
if dpkg --get-selections | grep -qs -E '^geoclue'; then
    apt-get --yes purge '^geoclue*'
fi
if dpkg --get-selections | grep -qs -E '^exim4'; then
    apt-get --yes purge '^exim4*'
fi

### Deinstall dependencies of the just removed packages.
apt-get --yes --purge autoremove
