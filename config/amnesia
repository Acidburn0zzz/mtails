# You'd better never directly edit this file: rather put your custom
# variable assignments in a new file called 'amnesia.local', in the
# same directory as this one. The values found in the '.local' file
# will override the ones from this one.
# 
# These configuration files are actually shell scripts, and are
# sourced by various other scripts.

# Supported: gnome|xfce
# Default: gnome
