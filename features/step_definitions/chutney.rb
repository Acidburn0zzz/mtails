  # At the moment this step essentially assumes that we boot with 'the

  # plugged'. I believe we can make this pretty transparent without
  # the need of a dedicated step by using tags (e.g. @fake_tor or
  # whatever -- possibly we want the opposite, @real_tor,
  # instead).
  #
  # There are two time points where we for a scenario must ensure that
  # the client configuration below is enabled if and only if the
  # scenario is tagged, and that is:
  #
  # 1. During a proper boot, as soon as the remote shell is up in the
  #    'the computer boots Tails' step.
  #
  # 2. When restoring a snapshot, in restore_background().
  #
  # If we do this, it doesn't even matter if a snapshot is made of an
  # untagged scenario (without the conf), and we later restore it with
  # a tagged scenario.
  #
  # Note: We probably have to clear the /var/lib/tor data dir when we
  # switch mode. Possibly there are other such problems that make this
  # abstraction impractical and it's better that we avoid it an go
  # with the more explicit, step-based approach.
