Feature: Additional software packages
  As a Tails user
  I may want to install softwares not shipped in Tails
  And have them installed automatically when I enable persistence in the Greeter

  Scenario: I am warned I can not use ASP when I start Tails from a DVD and install a package
    Given I have started Tails from DVD and logged in with an administration password and the network is connected
    And I update APT using apt
    When I install "sslh" using apt
    Then I am notified I can not use ASP for "sslh"
    And I can open the ASP documentation from the notification link

  Scenario: I can set up and use ASP when I install a package in a Tails that has no persistent partition
    Given I have started Tails without network from a USB drive without a persistent partition and stopped at Tails Greeter's login screen
    And I set an administration password
    And I log in to a new session
    And the network is plugged
    And Tor is ready
    And all notifications have disappeared
    And available upgrades have been checked
    And I update APT using apt
    And I install "sslh" using apt
    Then I am proposed to create an ASP persistence for the "sslh" package
    And I create the ASP persistence
    And I shutdown Tails and wait for the computer to power off
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" with network unplugged and I login with persistence enabled
    And the ASP persistence is correctly configured for package "sslh"
    And the additional software package installation service has started
    And the package "sslh" is installed

  Scenario: I can install packages in a Tails session with locked down persistence without being annoyed by ASP
    Given a computer
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" and I login with an administration password
    And I update APT using apt
    When I install "cowsay" using apt
    Then ASP has been started for "cowsay" and shuts up because the persistence is locked
    And the package "cowsay" is installed
