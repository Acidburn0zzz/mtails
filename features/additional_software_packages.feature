Feature: Additional software packages
  As a Tails user
  I may want to install softwares not shipped in Tails
  And have them installed automatically when I enable persistence in the Greeter

  # An issue with this feature is that scenarios depend on each
  # other. When editing this feature, make sure you understand these
  # dependencies (which are documented below).

  Scenario: I am warned I can not use ASP when I start Tails from a DVD and install a package
    Given I have started Tails from DVD and logged in with an administration password and the network is connected
    And I update APT using apt
    When I install "sslh" using apt
    Then I am notified I can not use Additional Software persistence for "sslh"
    And I open the Additional Software documentation from the notification link

  Scenario: I set up ASP when installing a package without persistent partition and the package is installed next time I start Tails
    Given I have started Tails without network from a USB drive without a persistent partition and stopped at Tails Greeter's login screen
    And I set an administration password
    And I log in to a new session
    And the network is plugged
    And Tor is ready
    And all notifications have disappeared
    And available upgrades have been checked
    And I update APT using apt
    And I install "sslh" using apt
    Then I am proposed to create an Additional Software persistence for the "sslh" package
    And I create the Additional Software persistence
    And I shutdown Tails and wait for the computer to power off
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" with network unplugged and I login with persistence enabled
    And the Additional Software persistence is correctly configured for package "sslh"
    And the additional software package installation service has started
    And the package "sslh" is installed

  # Depends on scenario: I set up ASP when installing a package without persistent partition and the package is installed next time I start Tails
  Scenario: I install packages in a Tails session with locked down persistence without being annoyed by ASP
    Given a computer
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" and I login with an administration password
    And I update APT using apt
    When I install "cowsay" using apt
    Then ASP has been started for "cowsay" and shuts up because the persistence is locked
    And the package "cowsay" is installed

    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" and I login with persistence enabled and an administration password
    And I start Synaptic
    And I update APT using Synaptic
    When I install "cowsay" using Synaptic
    And I accept adding "cowsay" to Additional Software persistence
    And I shutdown Tails and wait for the computer to power off

    When I uninstall "cowsay" using apt
    And I accept removing "cowsay" from Additional Software persistence
    And I shutdown Tails and wait for the computer to power off
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" with network unplugged and I login with persistence enabled
    Then the additional software package installation service has started
    And the package "cowsay" is not installed

  # Depends on scenario: I set up ASP when installing a package without persistent partition and the package is installed next time I start Tails
  Scenario: Packages I uninstall but don't want to remove from ASP are automatically installed
    Given a computer
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" and I login with persistence enabled and an administration password
    When I uninstall "sslh" using apt
    And I refuse removing "sslh" from Additional Software persistence
    And I shutdown Tails and wait for the computer to power off
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" with network unplugged and I login with persistence enabled

    And the package "sl" is not installed

  # Depends on scenario: Packages I uninstall and accept to remove from ASP are not installed anymore
  Scenario: Packages I have installed and added to ASP are upgraded when a network is available
    Given a computer
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" and I login with persistence enabled and an administration password
    # This step installs an old cowsay from a custom APT source
    When I install an old version "3.03+dfsg2-1" of the cowsay package using apt
    And I accept adding "cowsay" to Additional Software persistence
    And I shutdown Tails and wait for the computer to power off
    And I start Tails from USB drive "__internal" with network unplugged
    And I enable persistence
    # We need to add back the custom APT source for the ASP install step, as it
    # was not saved in persistence
    And I configure APT with a custom source for the old version of cowsay
    And I log in to a new session
    And the additional software package installation service has started
    And the package "cowsay" installed version is "3.03+dfsg2-1"
    # And then to remove it so that cowsay gets updated
    And I remove the custom APT source for the old cowsay version
