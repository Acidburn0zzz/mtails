<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>Tails does not protect against compromised hardware</h1>

<p>If the computer has been compromised by someone having physical access to it
and who installed untrusted pieces of hardware (like a keylogger), then it
might be unsafe to use Tails.</p>

<p><a id="untrusted_system"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>Tails can be compromised if installed or plugged in untrusted systems</h1>

<p>When starting your computer on Tails, it cannot be compromised by a virus in
your usual operating system, but:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tails should be installed from a trusted system. Otherwise it might be
corrupted during installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugging your Tails USB stick in a compromised operating system might
corrupt your Tails installation, and destroy the protection that Tails
provides. Only use your Tails USB stick to start Tails.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>See the <a href="../../support/faq.ru.html#compromised_system">corresponding FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><a id="bios"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>Tails does not protect against BIOS or firmware attacks</h1>

<p>It is also impossible for Tails to protect against attacks made through the
BIOS or other firmware embedded in the computer. These are not managed or
provided by the operating system directly, and no operating system can
protect against such attacks.</p>

<p>See for example, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNYsfUNegEA">attack on BIOS by
LegbaCore</a>.</p>

<p><a id="exit_node"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>Tor exit nodes can eavesdrop on communications</h1>

<p><strong>Tor is about hiding your location, not about encrypting your communication.</strong></p>

<p>Instead of taking a direct route from source to destination, communications
using the Tor network take a random pathway through several Tor relays that
cover your tracks. So no observer at any single point can tell where the
data came from or where it's going.</p>

<p><img src="./warning/htw2-tails.png" width="510" height="326" alt="A Tor connection usually goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing the actual connection to the final destination" class="img" /></p>

<p>The last relay on this circuit, called the exit node, is the one that
establishes the actual connection to the destination server. As Tor does
not, and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the
destination server, <strong>any exit node is in a position to capture any traffic
passing through it</strong>. See <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#CanExitNodesEavesdrop">Tor FAQ: Can exit nodes eavesdrop on
communications?</a>.</p>

<p>For example, in 2007, a security researcher intercepted thousands of private
email messages sent by foreign embassies and human rights groups around the
world by spying on the connections coming out of an exit node he was
running.  See <a href="http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/09/embassy_hacks">Wired: Rogue Nodes Turn Tor Anonymizer Into Eavesdropper's
Paradise</a>.</p>

<p><strong>To protect yourself from such attacks you should use end-to-end encryption.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tails includes many tools to help you using strong encryption</strong> while
browsing, sending email or chatting, as presented on our <a href="../../about.ru.html#cryptography">about
page</a>.</p>

<p><a id="fingerprint"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index5h1"></a>Tails makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably Tails</h1>

<p><strong>Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your local network administrator</strong>
can see that you're connecting to a Tor relay, and not a normal web server for
example. Using <a href="../first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode.ru.html">Tor bridges in certain
conditions</a> can help you hide the fact
that you are using Tor.</p>

<p><strong>The destination server that you are contacting through Tor</strong> can know whether your
communication comes from a Tor exit node by consulting the publicly
available list of exit nodes that might contact it. For example using the <a href="https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py">Tor
Bulk Exit List tool</a> from
the Tor Project.</p>

<p><strong>So using Tails doesn't make you look like any random Internet user.</strong>
The anonymity provided by Tor and Tails works by trying to make all of their
users look the same so it's not possible to identify who is who amongst them.</p>

<p>See also <a href="./fingerprint.ru.html">Can I hide the fact that I am using Tails?</a></p>

<p><a id="man-in-the-middle"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index6h1"></a>Man-in-the-middle attacks</h1>

<p>A man-in-the-middle attack (MitM) is a form of active eavesdropping in which
the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays
messages between them, making them believe that they are talking directly to
each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation
is controlled by the attacker.</p>

<p><img src="./warning/man-in-the-middle.png" width="555" height="302" alt="" class="img" /></p>




<p>While using Tor, man-in-the-middle attacks can still happen between the exit
node and the destination server. The exit node itself can also act as a
man-in-the-middle. For an example of such an attack see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120113162841/http://www.teamfurry.com/wordpress/2007/11/20/tor-exit-node-doing-mitm-attacks">MW-Blog: TOR
exit-node doing MITM
attacks</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Again, to protect yourself from such attacks you should use end-to-end
encryption</strong> and while doing so taking extra care at verifying the server
authenticity.</p>

<p>Usually, this is automatically done throught SSL certificates checked by your
browser against a given set of recognized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate%5Fauthority">certificate authorities</a>).
If you get a security exception message such as this one you might be the victim of
a man-in-the-middle attack and should not bypass the warning unless you have another
trusted way of checking the certificate's fingerprint with the people running
the service.</p>

<p><img src="./warning/ssl_warning.png" width="576" height="317" alt="This Connection is Untrusted" class="img" /></p>

<p>But on top of that the certificate authorities model of trust on the
Internet is susceptible to various methods of compromise.</p>

<p>For example, on March 15, 2011, Comodo, one of the major SSL certificates
authorities, reported that a user account with an affiliate registration
authority had been compromised. It was then used to create a new user
account that issued nine certificate signing requests for seven domains:
mail.google.com, login.live.com, www.google.com, login.yahoo.com (three
certificates), login.skype.com, addons.mozilla.org, and global trustee.  See
<a href="https://blog.comodo.com/other/the-recent-ra-compromise/">Comodo: The Recent RA
Compromise</a>.</p>

<p>Later in 2011, DigiNotar, a Dutch SSL certificate company, incorrectly
issued certificates to a malicious party or parties. Later on, it came to
light that they were apparently compromised months before, perhaps as far
back as May of 2009, or even earlier. Rogue certificates were issued for
domains such as google.com, mozilla.org, torproject.org, login.yahoo.com and
many more. See <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it">The Tor Project: The DigiNotar Debacle, and what you should
do about
it</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This still leaves open the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack even when
your browser is trusting an HTTPS connection.</strong></p>

<p>On one hand, by providing anonymity, Tor makes it more difficult to perform
a man-in-the-middle attack targeted at <strong>one specific person</strong> with the
blessing of a rogue SSL certificate. But on the other end, Tor makes it
easier for people or organizations running exit nodes to perform large scale
MitM attempts, or attacks targeted at <strong>a specific server</strong>, and especially
those among its users who happen to use Tor.</p>

<h1><a name="index7h1"></a>Confirmation attacks</h1>

<p>The Tor design doesn't try to protect against an attacker who can see or
measure both traffic going into the Tor network and also traffic coming out
of the Tor network. That's because if you can see both flows, some simple
statistics let you decide whether they match up.</p>

<p>That could also be the case if your ISP (or your local network
administrator)  and the ISP of the destination server (or the destination
server itself)  cooperate to attack you.</p>

<p>Tor tries to protect against traffic analysis, where an attacker tries to
learn whom to investigate, but Tor can't protect against traffic
confirmation (also known as end-to-end correlation), where an attacker tries
to confirm a hypothesis by monitoring the right locations in the network and
then doing the math.</p>

<p class="quoted-from">Quoted from <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough">Tor Project: "One cell
is enough to break Tor's anonymity"</a>.</p>


<h1><a name="index8h1"></a>Tails doesn't encrypt your documents by default</h1>

<p>The documents that you might save on storage devices will not be encrypted
by default, except in the <a href="../first_steps/persistence.ru.html">encrypted persistent
volume</a>.  But Tails provides you with tools to
encrypt your documents, such as GnuPG, or encrypt your storage devices, such
as LUKS.</p>

<p>It is also likely that the files you may create will contain evidence that
they were created using Tails.</p>

<p><strong>If you need to access the local hard-disks</strong> of the computer you are using, be
conscious that you might then leave trace of your activities with Tails on it.</p>

<h1><a name="index9h1"></a>Tails doesn't clear the metadata of your documents for you and doesn't encrypt the Subject: and other headers of your encrypted email messages</h1>

<p>Numerous files formats store hidden data or metadata inside of the
files. Word processing or PDF files could store the name of the author, the
date and time of creation of the file, and sometimes even parts of the
editing history of the file, depending on the file format and the software
used.</p>

<p>Please note also, that the Subject: as well as the rest of the header lines
of your OpenPGP encrypted email messages are not encrypted. This is not a
bug of Tails or the
<a href="http://www.mozilla-enigmail.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=328">OpenPGP</a>
protocol; it's due to backwards compatibility with the original SMTP
protocol. Unfortunately no RFC standard exists yet for Subject: line
encryption.</p>

<p>Image file formats, like TIFF of JPEG, probably take the prize for most
hidden data.  These files, created by digital cameras or mobile phones,
contain a metadata format called EXIF which can include the date, time and
sometimes the GPS coordinates when the picture was taken, the brand and
serial number of the device which took it, as well as a thumbnail of the
original image. Image processing software tends to keep this metadata
intact. The internet is full of cropped or blurred images in which the
included EXIF thumbnail still shows the original picture.</p>

<p><strong>Tails doesn't clear the metadata of your files for you</strong>. Yet. Still it's in
Tails' design goal to help you do that. For example, Tails already comes with
the <a href="https://mat.boum.org/">Metadata anonymisation toolkit</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="index10h1"></a>Tor doesn't protect you from a global adversary</h1>

<p>A global passive adversary would be a person or an entity able to monitor at
the same time the traffic between all the computers in a network. By
studying, for example, the timing and volume patterns of the different
communications across the network, it would be statistically possible to
identify Tor circuits and thus match Tor users and destination servers.</p>

<p>It is part of Tor's initial trade-off not to address such a threat in order
to create a low-latency communication service usable for web browsing,
Internet chat or SSH connections.</p>

<p>For more expert information see the Tor design paper, "<a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf">Tor Project: The
Second-Generation Onion
Router</a>",
specifically, "Part 3. Design goals and assumptions."</p>

<p><a id="identities"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index11h1"></a>Tails doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities</h1>

<p>It is usually not advisable to use the same Tails session to perform two
tasks or endorse two contextual identities that you really want to keep
separate from one another. For example hiding your location to check your
email and anonymously publishing a document.</p>

<p>First, because Tor tends to reuse the same circuits, for example, within the
same browsing session. Since the exit node of a circuit knows both the
destination server (and possibly the content of the communication if it's
not encrypted) and the address of the previous relay it received the
communication from, it makes it easier to correlate several browsing
requests as part of a same circuit and possibly made by the same user. If
you are facing a global adversary as described above, it might then also be
in a position to do this correlation.</p>

<p>Second, in case of a security hole or an error in using Tails or one of its
applications, information about your session could be leaked. That could
reveal that the same person was behind the various actions made during the
session.</p>

<p><strong>The solution to both threats is to shutdown and restart Tails</strong> every time
you're using a new identity, if you really want to isolate them better.</p>

<p>As explained in our documentation about
<a href="../anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser.ru.html#new_identity">Tor Browser</a>,
its <strong>New identity</strong> feature is not a perfect solution to separate
different contextual identities. And, as
<a href="../../support/faq.ru.html#new_identity">explained in the FAQ</a>, Tails does not
provide a global <span class="guilabel">New Identity</span>
feature. <strong>Shutdown and restart Tails instead.</strong></p>

<h1><a name="index12h1"></a>Tails doesn't make your crappy passwords stronger</h1>

<p>Tor allows you to be anonymous online; Tails allows you to leave no trace on
the computer you're using. But again, <strong>neither or both are magic spells for
computer security</strong>.</p>

<p>If you use weak passwords, they can be guessed by brute-force attacks with or
without Tails in the same way. To know if your passwords are weak and learn good
practices to create better password, you can read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak%5Fpassword%23Examples%5Fof%5Fweak%5Fpasswords">Wikipedia: Weak Passwords</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="index13h1"></a>Tails is a work in progress</h1>

<p>Tails, as well as all the software it includes, are continuously being
developed and may contain programming errors or security holes.</p>
