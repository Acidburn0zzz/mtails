<p>Trust is a very problematic issue, and that's the essence of why security is
difficult in every field, including computers and Internet communication. Do
you trust Tails and its developers? Do you think we have planted backdoors
in Tails so we can take control of your computer, or that we make Tails
generate compromised encryption keys in order to enable the government to
spy on you? Do you simply trust our word that we are legit?</p>

<p>No matter what your opinion is in this matter you should ask yourself how
you reached your conclusion. Both trust and distrust need to be established
based on facts, not gut feelings, paranoid suspicion, unfounded hearsay, or
our word. Of course, we claim to be honest, but written assurances are
worthless. In order to make an informed decision you must look at the
greater picture of what Tails is comprised of, our affiliations, and
possibly how others trust us.</p>

<p><a id="free_software"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>Free software and public scrutiny</h1>

<p>Free software, <a href="./license.pl.html">like Tails</a>, enables its users to check
exactly what the software distribution consists of and how it functions,
since the source code must be made available to all who receive it. Hence a
thorough audit of the code can reveal if any malicious code, like a
backdoor, is present. Furthermore, with the source code it is possible to
build the software, and then compare the result against any version that is
already built and being distributed, like the Tails ISO images that you can
download from us. That way it can be determined whether the distributed
version actually was built with the source code, or if any malicious changes
have been made.</p>

<p>Of course, most people do not have the knowledge, skills or time required to
do this, but due to public scrutiny anyone can have a certain degree of
implicit trust in Free software, at least if it is popular enough that other
developers look into the source code and do what was described in the
previous paragraph. After all, there is a strong tradition within the Free
software community to publicly report serious issues that are found within
software.</p>

<p><a id="trust_debian"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>Trusting Debian GNU/Linux</h1>

<p>The vast majority of all software shipped in Tails comes from the <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian
GNU/Linux distribution</a>. Debian is arguably the
Linux distribution whose software packages are under the deepest public
scrutiny. Not only is Debian itself one of the largest Linux distros, but
it's also one of the most popular distros to make derivatives from. Ubuntu
Linux, for instance, is a Debian derivative, and the same goes transitively
for all of its derivatives, like Linux Mint. Thus there are countless people
using Debian's software packages, and countless developers inspect their
integrity. Very serious security issues have been discovered (like the
infamous <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html">Debian SSH PRNG
vulnerability</a>),
but backdoors or other types of intentionally placed security holes have
never been found to our knowledge.</p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>Trusting Tor</h1>

<p>Tails anonymity is based on Tor, which is developed by <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">The Tor
Project</a>. The development of Tor is under a lot
of public scrutiny both academically (research on attacks and defenses on
onion routing) and engineering-wise (Tor's code has gone through several
external audits, and many independent developers have read through the
sources for other reasons). Again, security issues have been reported, but
nothing malicious like a backdoor -- we would argue that it's only
uninformed conspiracy theorists that speculate about deliberate backdoors in
Tor these days. Furthermore, Tor's distributed trust model makes it hard for
a single entity to capture an individual's traffic and effectively identify
them.</p>

<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>Trusting Tails</h1>

<p>One could say that Tails is the union of Debian and Tor. What we do,
essentially, is gluing it all together. Hence, if you trust Debian and The
Tor Project, what remains to establish trust for Tails is to trust our
"glue". As has been mentioned, Tails is Free software, so its source code is
completely open for inspection, and it mainly consists of a specification
for which Debian software packages to install and how they should be
configured. While Tails surely doesn't get the same amount of attention as
Debian or Tor, we do have some eyes on us, especially the Tor community, and
also some of the general security community (see our <a href="../../security/audits.html">audits
page</a>).  Given that Tails' source code is comparably small
and devoid of complexities, we're in a pretty good spot compared to many
other projects of similar nature. Our <a href="../../contribute/design.html">specification and design
document</a> is a good starting point to understand how
Tails works, by the way.</p>

<p>With all this in light (which you ideally also should try to verify), you
should be able to make an informed decision on whether or not you should
trust our software.</p>
