<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content" role="main">
<p>In 2015, we worked on a complete rewrite on our installation
instructions. This work was extended in 2017 with the design of a new
download page. The archive of our design process as well as pending
issues can be found in the <span class="createlink">corresponding
blueprint</span>.</p>

<p>Our previous instructions forced people to jump through many different
documentation pages and often to figure out by themselves what to do next. See
this <span class="createlink">flowchart of the installation process as of
2014</span>.</p>

<p>The objective was to make this a linear process, to be follow step-by-step, and
that would take the user from our homepage up to starting on a Tails USB stick
with a persistent volume. But this process has to be adapted to the base
operating system of the user or their technical expertise.</p>

<p>We decided to optimize it for first time and less technical users, while still
being usable by expert users.</p>

<p>The following scenarios are proposed:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../install/win/clone-overview.en.html">Install from another Tails (for PC)</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/mac/clone-overview.en.html">Install from another Tails (for Mac)</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/win/usb-overview.en.html">Install from Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/debian/usb-overview.en.html">Install from Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/expert/usb-overview.en.html">Install from Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint using the command line and GnuPG</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/linux/usb-overview.en.html">Install from other Linux distributions</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/mac/dvd-overview.en.html">Install from macOS by burning a DVD first</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/mac/usb-overview.en.html">Install from macOS and the command line</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/dvd.en.html">Burn a DVD</a></li>
<li><a href="../../install/download.en.html">Download without installing</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The installation assistant is also adapted to cover two <a href="../../upgrade.en.html">manual upgrade
scenarios</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../upgrade/clone-overview.en.html">Upgrade from another Tails</a></li>
<li><a href="../../upgrade/tails-overview.en.html">Upgrade inside Tails</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The assistant is divided into four sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="./installation_assistant.html#router"><em>router</em></a> which selects the scenario to follow.</li>
<li>The <a href="./installation_assistant.html#overview"><em>overview</em></a> which summarizes graphically the scenario.</li>
<li>The <a href="./installation_assistant.html#download"><em>download</em></a> page for downloading and verifying the ISO image.</li>
<li>The <a href="./installation_assistant.html#steps"><em>steps</em></a> which gives step-by-step instructions for the scenario after downloading.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>Implementation tricks</h1>

<p>The installation assistant is basically presenting very similar content in many
different scenarios with small variations (slightly different steps, slightly
different terminology, etc.).</p>

<p>To reuse as much content as possible and reduce the quantity of text and
translations, our implementation relies heavily on two tricks. Both are
quite hackish but were the only solution we found to avoid duplicating
massive amount of content in ikiwiki.</p>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>Ikiwiki inlines</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki/directive/inline/">inline directive</a> of
ikiwiki allows embedding a file into another file to avoid duplicating content.
It is quite limited and brittle, especially when used together with the PO
plugin. See <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6907">#6907</a>. Many inlines also slow down the build
process quite a lot.</p>

<h3><a name="index2h3"></a>Conditional CSS content</h3>

<p>To adapt a piece of content reused using ikiwiki inlines to the context
where it appears we are using CSS classes. For example, to introduce the
program used to install an intermediary Tails on Windows and Linux we
wrote:</p>

<pre>
&lt;span class="windows"&gt;a program called Universal USB Installer.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="linux"&gt;a program called GNOME Disks.&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>


<p>Elements with the <code>windows</code> class being only displayed in the Windows
scenario and elements with the
<code>linux</code> class being only displayed in the Linux scenario.</p>

<ul>
<li>Classes for elements potentially displayed on different pages:

<ul>
<li><code>clone</code> for content involving cloning</li>
<li><code>usb</code> for content with a USB stick as destination device</li>
<li><code>windows</code> for content for Windows</li>
<li><code>mac</code> for content for macOS</li>
<li><code>debian</code> for content for Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint</li>
<li><code>expert</code> for content for Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint on the command line</li>
<li><code>linux</code> for content for other Linux</li>
<li><code>upgrade</code> for content for manual upgrade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Classes for elements displayed only on one scenario:

<ul>
<li><code>dvd</code> for <a href="../../install/dvd-download.en.html">/install/dvd-download</a></li>
<li><code>vm</code> for <a href="../../doc/advanced_topics/virtualization.en.html">/doc/advanced topics/virtualization</a></li>
<li><code>download-only</code> for <a href="../../install/download.en.html">/install/download</a></li>
<li><code>install-clone</code> for <a href="../../install/clone.en.html">/install/clone</a></li>
<li><code>windows-usb</code> for <a href="../../install/win/usb.en.html">/install/win/usb</a></li>
<li><code>mac-usb</code> for <a href="../../install/mac/usb.en.html">/install/mac/usb</a></li>
<li><code>mac-dvd</code> for <a href="../../install/mac/dvd.en.html">/install/mac/dvd</a></li>
<li><code>mac-clone</code> for <a href="../../install/mac/clone.en.html">/install/mac/clone</a></li>
<li><code>debian-usb</code> for <a href="../../install/debian/usb.en.html">/install/debian/usb</a></li>
<li><code>expert-usb</code> for <a href="../../install/expert/usb.en.html">/install/expert/usb</a></li>
<li><code>linux-usb</code> for <a href="../../install/linux/usb.en.html">/install/linux/usb</a></li>
<li><code>upgrade-clone</code> for <a href="../../upgrade/clone.en.html">/upgrade/clone</a></li>
<li><code>upgrade-tails</code> for <a href="../../upgrade/tails.en.html">/upgrade/tails</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><a id="#router"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>Router</h1>

<p>The <em>router</em> is a sequence of multiple choices that determines which
installation scenario to follow. It is divided by operating systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>macOS</li>
<li>Linux with <code>APT</code> and <code>tails-installer</code>: Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint</li>
<li>Other Linux distributions</li>
</ul>


<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cloning is proposed as an alternative for all operating systems as it is
easier and faster.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Download only</em> is proposed as a minor option on the first page of the
router. This is an example of us optimizing for first time users: installing
Tails is very complex and we really want them to follow the full installation
instructions and not only download and try to figure out the rest by
themselves. This is especially true for those who think they are power users
which is a good share of our audience.</p>

<p><em>Download only</em> is not offered as an option from the
sidebar of the website for the same reason and to keep the sidebar as
simple as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Burning a DVD is also proposed as a minor option because:</p>

<ul>
<li>DVD are not very popular (13% of the WhisperBack reports received in
2015).</li>
<li>DVD do not benefit from automatic upgrades, so people might be more
quickly out-of-date.</li>
<li>DVD does not allow creating a persistent volume, so people cannot
rely on long lasting cryptographic keys to secure their
communication and might use weaker techniques.</li>
<li>For these same reasons we only provide a download and links to Ubuntu
instructions in the scenario.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Running in a virtual machine is proposed as a minor option because:</p>

<ul>
<li>VMs are not very popular (5% of the WhisperBack reports received in
2015).</li>
<li>VMs are less secure because the host operating system can monitor
them.</li>
<li>VMs make it harder to create a persistent volume, so people might
not rely on long lasting cryptographic keys to secure their
communication and might use weaker techniques.</li>
<li>For these same reasons we only provide a download and then point to the
documentation on virtualization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><a id="overview"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>Overview</h1>

<p>The <em>overview</em> is a single page summarizing graphically:</p>

<ul>
<li>The requirements of the installation scenario in terms of hardware
and time. This is important so that people get ready and make sure
beforehand that they have everything needed to complete the
scenario.</li>
<li>The different steps. This give a rough idea of what will happen
next and how complex it is. This is particularly important as the
<em>steps</em> are a single and very long page.</li>
</ul>


<p>For example, the content of the overview for installing from Debian is
stored in <a href="https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/wiki/src/install/debian/usb-overview.html">wiki/src/install/debian/usb-overview.html</a> which includes a common block of
HTML stored in <a href="https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/wiki/src/install/inc/overview.html">wiki/src/install/inc/overview.html</a> and uses the <code>debian</code> CSS
class to adapt to the scenario.</p>

<p><a id="download"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index5h1"></a>Download</h1>

<p>The download of the ISO image comes as a dedicated page between the
overview and steps (except for <code>clone</code>, <code>upgrade-clone</code>, and <code>expert</code>). It
is also available as a <a href="../../install/download.en.html">standalone page</a>.</p>

<p>The download is split as a dedicated page (while still labeled as "Step
1") to make it harder for people to skip the verification. It is still
possible to skip the download or even the verification but the link to
do so is labeled as a warning.</p>

<p>We propose two download techniques displayed in equal weight and combined
with two verification techniques that have a level of verification at least as
good as HTTPS:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>Direct download combined with a browser extension, called <em>Tails Verification</em>. See the <a href="./verification_extension.html">dedicated design
document</a> for a security analysis of this technique.</p></li>
<li><p>BitTorrent download. The Torrent file is downloaded through HTTPS
from our website and BitTorrent clients automatically verifies the download once
completed.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>We advertise OpenPGP verification as an optional verification technique,
possibly done on top of the other two techniques and ideally through the
OpenPGP Web-of-Trust. We assume that this technique is only relevant for
people who are already knowledgeable about OpenPGP. As a consequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>We only provide simplified instructions on how to perform the
verification, insisting on aspects that might still be relevant for
this public: verification of the date, command line options, warning
when the signing key is not trusted, etc.</li>
<li>We take more time to develop the verification of the signing key
through the OpenPGP Web of Trust because it is the only technique that is
really stronger than HTTPS.</li>
</ul>


<p><a id="steps"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index6h1"></a>Steps</h1>

<p>The <em>steps</em> for a given scenario is a very long page with step-by-step
instructions of the whole process.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is a single page so that people can get a feeling of what is left
to be done. During the tests, many people were scrolling up and down
the page, for example while waiting for an operation to complete or
when feeling that they missed something earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>The content of each step is written in an inline stored in
<code>install/inc/steps/*.inline.mdwn</code> which is inlined from the scenarios
themselves (for example <code>install/debian/usb.mdwn</code>) and adapted to each
scenario using CSS classes.</p></li>
</ul>
