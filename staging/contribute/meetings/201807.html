<h1><a name="index5h1"></a>Gather comments on our draft personas</h1>

<p>Chapter 3: <span class="createlink">Riou, the protest organizer</span></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Servers and censorship</p>

<ul>
<li><em>u: In order to publish this information they use websites which are
not in the country, so that the government cannot shut them down. →
we should write "not hosted on servers within the country"</em></li>
<li><em>u: Although they take photos and videos of the protests and try to
publish this information on websites which are censored within the
country.  → this sentence is a bit unclear</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Country &amp; context</p>

<ul>
<li><em>groente: i find it hard to comment because i know close to nothing
about the local context there</em></li>
<li><em>groente: i would argue for choosing another country where we do
actually know the local context and can make a realistic persona</em></li>
<li><em>groente: idk, sofar it reads rather emea-minded (Europe &amp;
Middle-East)</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: maybe i should have a look at a list of hard-core
censorship countries or ask OONI for countries/contextes and maybe
even contacts</em></li>
<li><em>groente: would turkey be a good alternative?</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: Iran would be another easy choice</em></li>
<li><em>u: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Iranian_protests
or this</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Umbrella movement</p>

<ul>
<li><em>sajolida: by the way, is the Umbrella movement still a thing?
should we made it more movement-agnostic?</em></li>
<li><em>u: no it's not a thing anymore</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Streaming</p>

<ul>
<li><em>u: They got to get it online as soon as it's produced on sociadia
and they also want to stream the protest and speeches.  → They got
to get it online and on social media as soon as it's produced. They
also want to stream the protest and speeches.</em></li>
<li><em>emmapeel: this picture taking and streaming sounds a bit
temerarious i think....</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: "They also want to stream the protest and speeches" -&gt;
isn't "stream" a bit misleading ? I doubt they'd try to do it live
(if they want to do that, that would probably be both difficult and
risky)</em></li>
<li><em>u: maybe "record" and later publish would be better</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: (the "record then publish" doesn't change the goal)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Device during the protest</p>

<ul>
<li><em>emmapeel: yes yes i see riou could do with a little hideout with
good connection, where the protestors will go ad give their memory
cards.</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: it's unclear to me with what device their take pictures
and record, since they also leave their phones at home: are they
using dedicates phone? other people's phone? offline cameras?</em></li>
<li><em>u: yeah maybe we need to say that they actually do use their phones
or that they use a video camera</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: I would say any of those three, I don't think this has any
influence on the challenges - or rather, the challenges seem
irrelevant in tails context</em></li>
<li><em>emmapeel: maybe riou wants to have some hidden camera o their
clothing</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Work before and after the protest</p>

<ul>
<li><em>sajolida: so their work with Tails could only occur before or after
the protests, right?</em></li>
<li><em>u: yes, or in some press center</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: so maybe we should get into more details regarding the
preparation and follow up of the protest, and leave aside the
technical details of their opsec during the protest, no?</em></li>
<li><em>u: sajolida: like at G20 people had such a press center → but this
event would be too controversial to make into a persona</em></li>
<li><em>emmapeel: riou eeds backups too, for the team to share the
different pictures like a mediagoblin or something</em></li>
<li><em>emmapeel: if the organizers communicate stealthily, maybe they can
share the pictures with onionshare</em></li>
<li><em>emmapeel: maybe they have one of those canon cameras with hacked
firmware and can encrypt the pictures when they are taken, just i
case they get caught</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Help other with censorship</p>

<ul>
<li><em>nodens: maybe another goal: "I want people to be able to easily
access censored information" ? Or is that not part of the persona ?</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: i think that Riou might be the kind of person has also
helps other access censored information</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: the phrasing would probably need to be refined but the idea
is that it is probably important for Kim that people in her/his
county can read the infromation</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: at least they are trying to spread censored information
within their country</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: so maybe Riou gives out Tails sticks during the
protest!!</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: yeah or advertises about Tails at least</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: or organises workshops during the protest :D</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: or gives out outreach material or translate Tails into
their language, etc.</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: (but that would be probably dangerous too. You don't want
to bring a laptop to this protest I guess)</em></li>
<li><em>groente: maybe riou runs a clandestine private bridge and wants to
share this with fellow protesters?</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: also, printed material (user manual for instance)</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: Oh I got a new one - "I want to know which websites are
censored in country" (a job for ONII Probe)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Technical level</p>

<ul>
<li><em>emmapeel: mahybe she is studying computer science</em></li>
<li><em>u: normal → power user i think</em></li>
<li><em>u: yeah, they are the more techie ones i think and have had a blog
before and used twitter</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: Riou look like one of these people we meet at the IFF,
well versed in anti-censorship tools and advocacy but without being
a Linux hacker either</em></li>
<li><em>emmapeel: riou will have a mac then! :S</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: and likes glitter</em></li>
<li><em>u: and a apfelphone :)</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: "I want to be able to type without external keyboard on my
Mac computer while using tails" ? ;)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Relationship with the press</p>

<ul>
<li><em>sajolida: does Riou work with journalists in their country? or the
"we do our stuff and never talk to the press" kind of protesters?</em></li>
<li><em>nodens: I'd say Riou might want to communicate anonymously with the
press</em></li>
<li><em>groente: answering that really requires knowledge of the local
context</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: are they only pushing stuff to the press or are they
collaborating more with them?</em></li>
<li><em>u: i think they work with journalists. but if that protest was the
G20 or some anticoal event in Germany, they would not</em></li>
<li><em>emmapeel: i think riou and her comrades should create a fictional
character that talks with the press</em></li>
<li><em>emmapeel: maybe they work with international journalists, like from
the guardian but not the ones in HongKong</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Resources</p>

<ul>
<li><em>groente: i can ask the folks at hivos/ddp if they have any contacts
in hong kong that could have a look at the persona</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
