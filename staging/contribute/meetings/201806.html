<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>Volunteers to handle "Hole in the roof" tickets this month</h1>

<p>Nope.</p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>Volunteers to handle important tickets flagged for next release, but without assignee</h1>

<p>There's none.</p>

<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>Availability and plans until the next meeting</h1>

<ul>
<li>intrigeri:

<ul>
<li>availability: ~half time or slightly more.</li>
<li>plans: keep the FT boat afloat, RM 3.8, finish my ASP
deliverables, stay on top of the VeraCrypt project since I'm now
more involved than I used to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sajolida:

<ul>
<li>availability: "Full" expect June 11-15.</li>
<li>plans: User testing for VeraCrypt, bug fixing for Additional
Software, kickoff the collaboration with Simply Secure, hopefully
do some work on donations (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14558">#14558</a>,
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14559">#14559</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>spriver: Translation platform, German translations</li>
<li>u: I will do some Tails work this month: translation platform, an
important accounting meeting, Debian work. Otherwise I want to
continue work on another project.</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index5h1"></a>Strategic planning: Containers/separated identities without rebooting</h1>

<p>We brainstormed why this could be a relevant goal:</p>

<ul>
<li>Even if we claim we don't support this, for many reasons users do
it anyway.</li>
<li>Making it easier to switch between one's "regular" identity
(outside of Tails) and a "secret" one (in Tails) was mentioned in
user interviews. But "without rebooting" is too limiting as there
may be other solutions to this problem.</li>
<li>Such a feature would be very innovative.</li>
<li>This feature could encourage people to use more
contextual identities.</li>
<li>Having to maintain multiple persistent configurations for multiple
contextual identities is time-consuming, when most of the
configuration (except identity-specific data) is common to all
of them.</li>
</ul>


<p>And then we brainstormed why this should not be a goal:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps this is not the best solution to the problems this solution
would solve: having Tails running on cheap tablets, or booting
faster, or being able to hibernate and resume quickly could achieve
similar results.</li>
<li>The main problem is to better support switching between the real
world and Tails (2 identities). Supporting 3 or more would only be
a slight improvement.</li>
<li>This solution requires a full redesign of Tails, its
implementation, how it presents itself to the user, etc. and the
cost/benefit is not worth is.</li>
</ul>


<p>And then we reached a consensus among the attendees: we drop this as
a goal but we replace it with a new one that is "make it easier to
switch between a Tails contextual identity and another identity
outside of Tails".</p>

<h1><a name="index6h1"></a>Gather comments on our draft personas</h1>

<p>Chapter 2: <span class="createlink">Cris, the sensitive information gatherer</span></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Public opinion</p>

<ul>
<li><em>u: I would formulate this sentence differently: "Turn public opinion against these people."
maybe "inform the public about the wrongdoings of these people"</em></li>
<li><em>u: well, i just realize the previous sentence is a bit similar</em></li>
<li><em>u: maybe "make it possible to legally accuse these people / put
them in front of a court" ?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Pseudonym</p>

<ul>
<li><em>intrigeri: something is not clear to me: Cris is a journalist who
publishes under a pseudonym, right? I have no clue how common
practice it is. Have you?</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: i agree with you. maybe Cris is working under their
realname and hiding what they are working on only until it's
published.</em></li>
<li><em>intrigeri: indeed, that would relate to many more real-life cases
I'm aware of but I don't know the press world well.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Refugee</p>

<ul>
<li><em>u: as cris is a mexican refugee i'm unsure how they can enter
mexico</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: i used "refugee" but i think that Cris might just be too
scared to live in Mexico (bad stuff happens there to journalists)
but not legally prohibited to enter Mexico</em></li>
<li><em>intrigeri: s/is Mexican refugee/is a Mexican refugee/</em></li>
<li><em>u: ok, then maybe we shoudl use another word than refugee?
emigrant/immigrant?</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: ok for replacing "refugee" (we'll find a better word
elsewhere)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Hide information about myself</p>

<ul>
<li><em>drebs: why is "hide information about myself" different from "hide
my identity"?</em></li>
<li><em>u: i think hiding your identity is basically only about your name
while information about yourself can be many other things like where
you live, where you currently are etc.</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: under "hide information about myself" we also put
location for example</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Too extreme</p>

<ul>
<li><em>intrigeri: my "raw subjectivity" comment: it's an important persona
and one of the things we know at least some people use for. It's an
extreme/minority one though. Thankfully the other personas balance
things so the draft set of personas does not err to far on the
"Tails for 2000 people" side :)</em></li>
<li><em>intrigeri: (because there's so many life/death threats on the same
person &amp; relationships)</em></li>
<li><em>sajolida: but Cris could also be anybody carrying sensitive
information across borders for example</em></li>
<li><em>u: but cris need not be a journalist, they can be a human rights
advocate, diplomat, doctor</em></li>
<li><em>u: i don't think this persona is extreme, but it's maybe more
rare.</em></li>
</ul>
