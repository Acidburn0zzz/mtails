<p>This report covers the activity of Tails in October 2016. It is the
final report for our current contract with OTF. We want to thank OTF
for their support, that enabled us to deliver a large set of
improvements to various people, including: Tails users, Tails
contributors, users of Debian and its numerous derivatives,
Thunderbird users, and more!</p>

<p>Everything in this report is public.</p>

<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A.1.1. Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard</p>

<p>As <a href="./2016_09.html">reported last month</a>,
this work has been merged, and this deliverable is now completed.</p></li>
<li><p>A.1.2. Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove</p>

<p>As <a href="./2016_09.html">reported last month</a>,
this deliverable was completed: our patches were submitted to
Thunderbird upstream, and we keep working with them to make sure that
all users of Thunderbird benefit from a safer configuration wizard.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>B. Improve our quality assurance process</h1>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>B.3.11. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and faster</p>

<p>After having worked on this continuously for over a year, our test
suite runs faster despite testing more cases than before; also, it reports
much fewer false positives. We now are in a state where we can rely on
its results as intended:</p>

<ul>
<li>When reviewing someone else's work, automated testing results
allows us to quickly rule out many classes of regressions.</li>
<li>When introducing new features and bug fixes in general, they make us
a lot more comfortable.</li>
</ul>


<p>That said, we clearly underestimated the amount of work needed for the
robustness part of this deliverable, and there are some outstanding
issues still remaining before we could have no false positives <em>at all</em>.
However, it should be stressed that the issues are rare enough that the
automated test suite still is as useful as described in the previous
paragraph, so we consider this a success nevertheless.</p>

<p>This deliverable is now completed.</p></li>
<li><p>B.3.12. Reliably wait for post-Greeter hooks (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5666">#5666</a>)</p>

<p>This work has been merged, so this deliverable is now completed.</p></li>
<li><p>B.3.14. Write tests for incremental upgrades (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6309">#6309</a>)</p>

<p>This work has been merged, so this deliverable is now completed.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>C. Scale our infrastructure</h1>

<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors</h2>

<p>We completed the remaining bits of this deliverable, and deployed
everything to production:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>C.1.2. Write &amp; audit the code that makes the redirection decision from our website (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8639">#8639</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8640">#8640</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11109">#11109</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>mirror-dispatcher.js</code>: our security auditor did a final
security review, and approved this code.</p></li>
<li><p>Download And Verification Extension (DAVE) for Firefox: our code
to use our new mirror pool when downloading Tails ISO images was
completed, merged, released and made it into Mozilla's
stable channel.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This deliverable is now completed.</p></li>
<li><p>C.1.6. Adjust download documentation to point to the mirror pool dispatcher's URL (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8642">#8642</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11329">#11329</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10295">#10295</a>)</p>

<p>This was completed back in May.</p></li>
<li><p>C.1.8. Clean up the remainers of the old mirror pool setup (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8643">#8643</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11284">#11284</a>)</p>

<p>This deliverable was completed as well.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>C.4. Maintain our already existing services</h2>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>C.4.6. Administer our services upto milestone VI</h3>

<p>We kept on answering the requests from the community, and taking care
of security updates.</p>

<h4><a name="index1h4"></a>New pieces of infrastructure</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>We created a virtual machine that will be used to experiment with
our upcoming web translation platform. This allows us to try
separating <em>system</em> administration from <em>services</em> administration:
we want to allow other Tails contributors to set up and maintain
the services they need, which will make our system administrators
less of a bottleneck :)</p></li>
<li><p>We finished taking over from Riseup the system that hosts our ticket
tracker: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11855">#11855</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11805">#11805</a>,
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11843">#11843</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11844">#11844</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index2h4"></a>Performance and resource usage improvements</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>We made more progress on optimizing I/O settings for virtual
machines running on our main server (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11817">#11817</a>).
Our short-term goal was to get better performance out of our
current hardware, and we are calling this a success: we have
lowered IO wait times, and improved disk throughput. This also
allowed us to learn more about the capacity of our actual setup so
we can specify the hardware to purchase in 2017.</p></li>
<li><p>Our new APT snapshots system generates about 7GB of data for every
Tails release.
We <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11830">implemented de-duplication</a> for
this data, which will cut down storage costs on the long term, and
makes the backup process smoother on the short term.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index3h4"></a>Security improvements</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>We have changed the way we create virtual machines to
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10092">make it safer</a>, thanks to a new
feature in <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/di%2Dnetboot%2Dassistant">di-netboot-assistant</a> that was implemented
after we requested it.</p></li>
<li><p>We have <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8192">enabled HTTPS</a> on (almost) all
the sub-domains of <code>tails.boum.org</code>, thanks to Let's Encrypt.
This allowed us to proceed with the next steps that will eventually
result in adding <code>tails.boum.org</code> to the Chrome HSTS preload list
(that is used by other major web browsers as well).</p></li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index4h4"></a>Workflow improvements</h4>

<ul>
<li>We started setting up a replica of our automated ISO builds and
tests infrastructure. This lead to quite some refactoring of our
Puppet code. It will allow us to develop infrastructure changes
more easily outside of our production environment.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index5h4"></a>Porting our infrastructure to new versions of the technologies it uses</h4>

<ul>
<li>We started to implement <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11384">our plan</a> to
migrate our infrastructure to Puppet 4, proceeding with the first
step that was
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11835">upgrading our Puppet master and clients to 3.8</a>.
Then we quickly tried to
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11836">stop stringifying Puppet facts</a> but
had no time to deal with the fallout, so we reverted this change
and documented what the next steps are.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11874">fixed the way</a> our test suite
handles the pluging and unplugging of DVD devices, as well as the
ejection of the ISO image, to adapt to compatibility issues between
QEMU 2.7 and Jessie's libvirt on this matter.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index6h4"></a>Bug fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>We (most likely) fixed <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11803">a bug</a> that
sometimes prevented Jenkins jobs from being created or updated.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index7h4"></a>Future plans</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>We identified new aspects of our systems that need to be monitored:
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11870">#11870</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11858">#11858</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to improve the reliability of our continuous integration
system, by relying less on remote network resources:
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11869">#11869</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We started thinking about better ways to
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11880">handle our servers' logs</a> and
making plans.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>E. Release management</h1>
