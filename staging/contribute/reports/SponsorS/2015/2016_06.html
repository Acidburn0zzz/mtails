<p>This report covers the activity of Tails in June 2016.</p>

<p>Everything in this report is public.</p>

<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove</h1>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>A.1.1. Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard</h2>

<p>Despite having thouroughly tested our work on reenabling the
autoconfiguration wizard in Icedove, we received reports, that in some
cases where the ISP uses OAuth, as for example Gmail, people were
unable to set up an email account. One of these issues, the spurious
inability to set up accounts, has been resolved and will be available
in the next Tails release ( <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11550">#11550</a>). The OAuth issue
has been identified and is currently being worked on
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11536">#11536</a>). A third issue concerning intermittently
failing TLS connections needs more testing (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10933">#10933</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>A.1.2. Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove</h2>

<p>The second iteration of our patches for Icedove has been reviewed and
integration with upstream's testing suite has been asked for in reply.
We've been working on writing tests for our patches, but another
iteration of those is necessary. See the
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=971347">upstream bug</a> for details.</p>

<p>The Tor project has released
<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torbirdy-020-sixth-beta-release">Torbirdy 0.2.0</a>
on June 27th 2016. This release contains patches we wrote,
as well as patches by Arthur Edelstein, that fix the privacy leaks
identified initially by taqnaq. An updated Debian package is currently
being uploaded.</p>

<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>B. Improve our quality assurance process</h1>

<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite</h2>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>B.3.10. Write automated tests for features added in 2016Q1</h3>

<p>We added a new test for the Tails Greeter "Disable all networking"
option (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10340">#10340</a>).</p>

<p>Since we dropped Vidalia as it was not maintained anymore, and replaced
it with Tor Status and Onion Circuits, we adapted our test suite accordingly
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6841">#6841</a>).</p>

<p>We had to update some test suite scenarios after having enabled Tor
Browser's font fingerprinting protection in Tails, as most of its
related screenshots didn't work anymore (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11097">#11097</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="index2h3"></a>B.3.11. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and faster</h3>

<p>We've identified the reason why sometimes our test suite is not
able to add the necessary kernel command line options to the Tails
system it tests. The fix is not that easy to implement, and solutions
are being worked on. A patch is under test and we intend to fix this
issue in July (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10777">#10777</a>).</p>

<p>We've investigated why our test suite sometimes fails because of time
synchronization errors. Auditing our <a href="../../../design/Time_syncing.html">htpdate
script</a> showed that it may not have the
best defaults for it to work correctly on sloppy network connections. A
patch has been proposed and is being tested (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10494">#10494</a>).</p>

<p>A patch implementing a way to retry Synaptic related tests on
network transient errors or if Synaptic segfaults is under test and will
be proposed to be merged soon (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10441">#10441</a> and
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10412">#10412</a>).</p>

<p>We also implemented a similar solution on the Git scenarios, which have proven
to be fragile because of network errors. A patch has been widely tested,
and will likely be merged soon (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10444">#10444</a>).</p>

<p>Thanks to Dogtail (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10721">#10721</a>), whose integration was
worked on in the past few months, we could make a robust fix for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The "the Tor Browser loads the (startup page|Tails roadmap) step is
fragile (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10376">#10376</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>and also make the implementation simpler and more future proof for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjust test suite after upgrading Tor Browser to the 6.0.x series,
based on Firefox 45.2 (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11403">#11403</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="index3h3"></a>B.3.13. Reorganize the "various checks" feature (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5707">#5707</a>)</h3>

<p>A branch that splits this feature's scenarios into more relevant
thematic features has been proposed for review. It should be merged
soon.</p>

<h3><a name="index4h3"></a>B.3.14. Write tests for incremental upgrades (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6309">#6309</a>)</h3>

<p>A branch testing the Tails incremental upgrades have been pushed and
proposed to review. Issues with it were raised and a fix promptly
pushed. It's receiving the last round of review and will likely be
merged soon.</p>

<h3><a name="index5h3"></a>B.3.15. Write automated tests for features added in 2016Q2</h3>

<p>A test was proposed to review, that covers a regression we have
identified and fixed a few months ago, in one of Tails' persistence
features (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10840">#10840</a>).</p>

<p>We added a test for reconfiguring an existing persistence partition — we only tested
its initial creation so far (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10834">#10834</a>).</p>

<p>After forbidding the Tor Browser to start any external application
(for improved security, see <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9285">#9285</a>) a test that
previously did just that was converted to a test for downloading
files.</p>

<p>While upgrading the Tor Browser to the 6.0.x series, based on a new
major Firefox release (45.2, see <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11403">#11403</a>) tests were
adjusted to new application behavior and appearance of the browser's
graphical user interface.</p>

<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>B.4. Freezable APT repository</h2>

<p>The system has been working fine in production for a while now, and as
reported last month all parts of this deliverable have now been completed.</p>

<p>In June, we have polished a bit the design documentation for the
entire setup (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11447">#11447</a>).</p>

<p>And, in July we want to do various polishing tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If needed, write helper tools for freeze exceptions
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11448">#11448</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Investigate a weird issue we have identified, when a package is
not removed from our time-based APT snapshots, while it should be
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11496">#11496</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Deal with the consequences that our new APT snapshots system has
on our server's <code>apt-cacher-ng</code> cache size (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11532">#11532</a>).</p></li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>C. Scale our infrastructure</h1>

<h2><a name="index5h2"></a>C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors</h2>

<p>We now have 39 active mirrors.</p>

<p>The work that remains to be done in July is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>C.1.2. Write &amp; audit the code that makes the redirection decision from our website (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8639">#8639</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8640">#8640</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11109">#11109</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>mirror-dispatcher.js</code>: we are still waiting for the auditor to do
a final security review.</p></li>
<li><p>Download And Verification Extension (DAVE) for Firefox: the code
needs to be reviewed by the original author of the extension and the
code for resuming downloads still needs to be improved and tested.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>C.1.8. Clean up the remainders of the old mirror pool setup (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8643">#8643</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11284">#11284</a>)</p>

<p>This is now only blocked by the work that is in progress on DAVE
(C.1.2).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index6h2"></a>C.4. Maintain our already existing services</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>C.4.6. Administer our services up to milestone VI</p>

<p>We kept on answering the requests from the community and taking care
of security updates.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11213">refactored</a> the Puppet bits that
configure our servers' firewall.</p>

<p>We debugged and fixed a nasty problem that prevented the <code>testing</code>
Git branch from being automatically tested on our infrastructure
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11499">#11499</a>).</p>

<p>One of us participated in a Puppet sprint at
<a href="https://debconf16.debconf.org/">DebCamp</a>, where a team did improved
the <code>puppet</code> and <code>apt</code> modules we are using on our infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul>
