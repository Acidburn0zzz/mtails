<p>This report covers the activity of Tails in August 2016.</p>

<p>Everything in this report is public.</p>

<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove</h1>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>A.1.1. Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard</h2>

<p>In June we reported that some account setup issues have been
discovered with the introduction of our patches which should protect
the user by forcing the use of secure protocols in Icedove.
We've managed to fix the intermittently failing TLS connections and
released this in Tails 2.5 (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11550">#11550</a>,
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10933">#10933</a>). The OAuth issue has been identified and
a fix has been committed (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11536">#11536</a>). We are currently
thoroughly testing this patch and as soon as the tests conclude
positive, we will resubmit this patch upstream.</p>

<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>A.1.2. Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove</h2>

<p>We've successfully provided an AppArmor profile to Debian's Icedove
package. It can now also be used by other Debian users and thus it
profits from their testing, bug reports and patches
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11058">#11058</a>).</p>

<p>We've started incorporating this AppArmor profile into Tails in the
meantime, until our patches get merged and we can start to ship the
default Debian Icedove package. However, this still needs some small
adjustments as well as testing (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10750">#10750</a>).</p>

<p>As for our patches, we've greatly improved them and upstream has now
even asked us for news, which is good! As soon as we have tested the
aforementioned OAuth issue, we'll resubmit them upstream
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6165">#6165</a>).</p>

<p>As for our Torbirdy patches which had already landed upstream, they've
now also landed in Debian unstable as well as in jessie-backports.</p>

<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>B. Improve our quality assurance process</h1>

<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>B.2 Continuously run our test suite on ISO images built by Jenkins</h2>

<p>We want to identify which ones, among the flaky automated tests that
are currently disabled on our continuous integration infrastructure,
will be fixed simply by porting Tails to Debian 9 (Stretch). So we
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11752">introduced a way</a> to force running <em>all</em>
tests for a given branch, even the ones flagged as "fragile". In a few
months we will have enough data to adjust these test flakiness
annotations, and hopefully to re-allow a number of these tests to run
on our Jenkins infrastructure.</p>

<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite</h2>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>B.3.11. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and faster</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>We started porting Tails to Debian 9 (Stretch). Adjusting our test
suite to make it able to provide feedback about our early Tails 3.0
ISO images is a critical part of this project. To do so, in the past
we had to go through a tedious process of updating the dozens of
pictures that we ask Sikuli to recognize; but this time, thanks to
the work we <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10721">recently did</a> to support
Dogtail in our test suite, we are able to <em>remove</em> many such
pictures, and replace them with higher-level means of interacting
with graphical user interfaces. So far we could remove 31 such
images. This change brings two major benefits: it makes our test
suite more robust, and it makes our project more sustainable, by
decreasing the cost of porting Tails to future versions of Debian.</p></li>
<li><p>As part of porting Tails to Debian 9 (Stretch), we fixed one root
cause of flakiness in our test suite by integrating the Florence
virtual keyboard more reliably into the GNOME desktop
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11479">#11479</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8312">#8312</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Until recently, the parts of our test suite that rely on emulated
USB storage devices were fragile on our Jenkins setup.
This prevented us from running a number of tests there, e.g.
those involving persistence. We kept working on it, as reported last
month, both <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11590">in Tails Installer itself</a>
and in our test suite (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11588">#11588</a>,
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11582">#11582</a>). As a result, we were able to re-enable
these tests on production branches in August.</p></li>
<li><p>The branch fixing the Synaptic scenario that was marked as fragile has been
merged for Tails 2.6 (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10441">#10441</a>). This also fixes two other
problems regarding this scenario (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10412">#10412</a> and
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10900">#10900</a>). In the end, all tests about the installation of
Debian packages in Tails are back in our test suite.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="index2h3"></a>B.3.12. Reliably wait for post-Greeter hooks (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5666">#5666</a>)</h3>

<p>We plan to complete this by the end of October.</p>

<h3><a name="index3h3"></a>B.3.14. Write tests for incremental upgrades (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6309">#6309</a>)</h3>

<p>We plan to complete this by the end of October.</p>

<h2><a name="index5h2"></a>B.4. Freezable APT repository</h2>

<p>This was completed already, but still we have a couple updates
about it.</p>

<p>This piece of infrastructure has already proven its great usefulness
in practice, for a use case that we had not imagined yet: we've just
had a first one-week sprint to kick-start porting Tails to Debian 9
(Stretch). Thanks to our Debian archive snapshots, we were able to
select a known-good state of the Debian archive and use it for the
entire week, without having to cope with a landscape that would be
constantly changing under our feet. This way we could focus on the
task at hand.</p>

<p>We solved a <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11612">design problem</a> in how we
handle frozen APT repositories for bugfix releases, that we had
identified in July during the Tails 2.5 release process.</p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>C. Scale our infrastructure</h1>

<h2><a name="index6h2"></a>C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>C.1.2. Write &amp; audit the code that makes the redirection decision from our website (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8639">#8639</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8640">#8640</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11109">#11109</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>mirror-dispatcher.js</code>: we are still waiting for the auditor to do
a final security review.</p></li>
<li><p>Download And Verification Extension (DAVE) for Firefox: no
progress was made on this front in August. Improving and testing
the code for resuming downloads is among our top priorities
in September.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>C.1.6. Adjust download documentation to point to the mirror pool dispatcher's URL (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8642">#8642</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11329">#11329</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10295">#10295</a>)</p>

<p>This was completed back in May.</p></li>
<li><p>C.1.8. Clean up the remainers of the old mirror pool setup  (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8643">#8643</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11284">#11284</a>)</p>

<p>This is only blocked by the work that is in progress on DAVE (C.1.2).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index7h2"></a>C.4. Maintain our already existing services</h2>

<h3><a name="index4h3"></a>C.4.6. Administer our services upto milestone VI</h3>

<p>We kept on answering the requests from the community and taking care
of security updates.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We've downgraded the Puppet agent installed in a VM that is running Debian
Sid so that it remains compatible with out Puppetmaster. <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11543">#11543</a></p></li>
<li><p>We tuned the Icinga2 memory check limits on one of our VMs to avoid false
positives.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>E. Release management</h1>

<h2><a name="index8h2"></a>E.1.12. Tails 2.5</h2>
