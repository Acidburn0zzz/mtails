<p>This report covers the activity of Tails in January 2016.</p>

<p>Everything in this report can be made public.</p>

<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove</h1>

<p>Last month we modified our Icedove schedule quite a bit. Due to
sickness, some work has been delayed while other tasks have moved
forward faster than expected.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A.1.1 Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6154">#6154</a></p>

<p>The proof-of-concept branch that integrates the secured wizard into
Tails is delayed until the end of February and should be released in
2.4 instead.</p>

<p>We've been evaluating our own patches for Icedove against those
reported to Mozilla's bugtracker and are happy to announce that our
patches would provide an option to accept only secure protocols, as
a user opt-in. These patches will be submitted to Mozilla's bugtracker
and hopefully integrated upstream.
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7064">#7064</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A.1.2 Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove</p>

<p>Unfortunately we also discovered that the autoconfig wizard of Icedove does
not always use the configured proxy. This means that some traffic can leak.
This is not a security problem in Tails since we drop non-Tor
traffic by default, but for this very reason it breaks the
functionality of the autoconfig wizard in the context of Tails.
We started to write a proof-of-concept patch to fix this bug which
will be submitted upstream in February.</p>

<p>We've worked out a set of strong arguments before actually presenting
our patches to upstream. We are now ready to do that (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6156">#6156</a>).</p>

<p>In order to improve Icedove's security in Tails and avoid unforeseen exploits,
we started evaluating an AppArmor profile for Icedove (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10750">#10750</a>).
We've asked the author to submit it upstream where it's now waiting to be merged.
In the meantime, we will consider shipping this profile in Tails on our own.</p></li>
<li><p>A.1.4. Provide a migration path for our users from Claws Mail to Icedove</p>

<p>This was completed in time for the first release of Icedove in Tails 1.8 (December 15).</p></li>
<li><p>A.1.6. Release Icedove in Tails</p>

<p>Icedove was made the default email client in Tails 1.8 (December 15)
and Claws Mail was removed from Tails in version 2.0 (January 26).</p></li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>B. Improve our quality assurance process</h1>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>B.1. Automatically build ISO images for all the branches of our source code that are under active development</h2>

<p>In January, <strong>757 ISO images</strong> were automatically built by our Jenkins
instance.</p>

<p>We worked on designing and implementing a workaround for an issue in our
autobuild setup: it sometimes happens that a build fails and leaves its
temporary directories. The subsequent builds happening on the same
system then always fail as they lack space in the /tmp/ directory.
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10772">#10772</a>)</p>

<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>B.2. Continuously run our entire test suite on all those ISO images once they are built</h2>

<p>In January, all the <strong>757 ISO images</strong> that were built were also tested by our Jenkins instance.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>B.2.4. Implement and deploy the best solution from this research: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5288">#5288</a></p>

<p>We installed the Jenkins <code>Cluster Statistics</code> plugin in order to get a
better idea of our Jenkins slaves usage. (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10969">#10969</a>)</p>

<p>We consider our setup deployed but still needing adjustments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We planned to design a collective way to check regulary for false
positives and fragile scenarios, as it has proven to be not that well
handled by our team. This is planned to be discussed and implemented at
our monthly CI team meeting in February. (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10993">#10993</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>We still need to investigate a bug we've seen with the usage of the
Jenkins Cucumber Test Result plugin that is likely to only have been due
to a change we made in our infrastructure at the same moment it was
running. (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10725">#10725</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>We've sometimes seen some of our ISO testing VMs going offline and being
unavailable for new jobs. We tried a workaround, but we still need to
check if it worked. (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10601">#10601</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>B.3.7. Automatically test behavior on boot medium removal: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5472">#5472</a></p>

<p>This was implemented and merged.</p></li>
<li><p>B.3.11. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and faster</p>

<p>We've marked some more scenarios as fragile, as we noticed there
were still some false positives (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10863">#10863</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Encrypting and signing a message using an OpenPGP key (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10991">#10991</a>)</li>
<li>OpenPGP applet key selection window badly handled (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10992">#10992</a>)</li>
<li>Viewing and printing a PDF file (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10994">#10994</a>)</li>
<li>MAC address spoofing (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10774">#10774</a>)</li>
<li>Tails Installer (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10720">#10720</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>The test suite machinery sometimes misses the boot splash
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10777">#10777</a>): a branch was proposed.</p>

<p>Some research was done on a bug that we can't reproduce anymore now
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10504">#10504</a>).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>B.4. Freezable APT repository</h2>

<p>This was put aside in January, while the developer responsible for
this project was focusing on porting Tails to Debian Jessie. Some
progress was made nevertheless.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>B.4.6. Adjust the rest of our ecosystem to the freezable APT repository: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6303">#6303</a></p>

<p>We completed our evaluation of the hardware resources required by
our draft design (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6295">#6295</a>), purchased and set up the
needed storage (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10851">#10851</a>). Next step on this front is
to adjust our backup system, and our fail-over system once we
have one.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>C. Scale our infrastructure</h1>

<h2><a name="index5h2"></a>C.2. Be able to detect within hours failures and malfunction on our services</h2>

<p>Deciding on how to deploy new hosts in our current Puppet setup took a bit
more time than planned. A solution has been proposed, and once agreed upon, it
will be deployed in production, which should happen in the beginning of
February.</p>

<p>Once this is done, we'll be able to start the deployment of the
monitoring software on the new host, and implement the first critical
checks. That has already been tested in the prototype. This will happen
during February.</p>

<p>Implementing other checks is planned for the end of February and
beginning of March, as well as starting the setup of notifications to
our sysadmins. In the end, we'll spend most of the rest of March and
beginning of April to refine our setup, mostly on the notification part.
This should lead us toward the completion of the whole C.2 deliverable
before M5 is over.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>C.2.1. Research and decide what monitoring solution to use
       what tools and abstraction layer to use for configuring it,
       and where to host it: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8645">#8645</a></p>

<p>We decided to use Icinga 2 that seems to fit our specifications best.
It will be installed on a dedicated virtual machine hosted in
a different data center than all the services it will monitor.</p>

<p>Our prototype (see C.2.2) helped us validate this choice against our
requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>C.2.2. Set up the monitoring software and the underlying infrastructure</p>

<p>We deployed a prototype and are now waiting for the final host to be
configured to put it into production.</p></li>
<li><p>C.2.4. Configure and debug the monitoring of the most critical services: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8650">#8650</a></p>

<p>Our prototype is already set up to monitor all the checks that we ranked as
critical in our blueprint.</p></li>
<li><p>C.2.5. Configure the receiving side of the monitoring notifications: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8651">#8651</a></p>

<p>During the discussion about which services to check, we
defined our needs concerning notifications. This will be handled
after the monitoring software is deployed on the production host.</p></li>
<li><p>C.2.6. Configure and debug the monitoring of other high-priority services: <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8653">#8653</a></p>

<p>Some of these checks are already integrated in the default setup of the
monitoring software or part of the basics checks already handled and
easy to setup. Some have been tested on the prototype.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index6h2"></a>C.4. Maintain our already existing services</h2>

<p>We kept on answering the requests from the community as well as taking
care of security updates as covered by "C.4.4. Administer our services
up to milestone IV" and "C.4.5. Administer our services up to milestone
V" until the end of January.</p>

<p>We proposed a design to administer our new monitoring machine with Puppet
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10760">#10760</a>).</p>

<p>We fixed a bug in our Puppet manifests that prevented us to deploy
new ISO tester systems. We improved the toolbox we use to compute
statistics about the load put on our Jenkins workers, and
their performance.</p>

<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>D. Migration to Debian Jessie</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>D.1.1. Adjust to the change of desktop environment to GNOME Shell</p>

<p>This was completed back in November 2015.</p></li>
<li><p>D.3.1 Update our test suite for Tails Jessie</p>

<p>This was completed (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7563">#7563</a>).</p>

<p>The only remaining issues are a few robustness ones, such as
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10900">#10900</a>. They will be handled as part of the "B.3.11.
Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and
faster" deliverable.</p></li>
<li><p>D.4.1 Document the changes implied by the move to Jessie on our website</p>

<p>We adapted all of our user documentation to Jessie (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7584">#7584</a>). For example we
entirely rewrote the <a href="../../../../doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop.en.html">introduction to
GNOME</a> and the
<a href="../../../../doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes.en.html">documentation on encrypted partitions</a>.</p>

<p>While reworking these pages we simplified and improved some of
the oldest parts of our documentation. This process also involved new
contributors who wrote documentation for Tails for the first time.</p></li>
<li><p>D.5.1 Release an official version of Tails based on Jessie</p>

<p>We put out a <a href="../../../../news/test_2.0-rc1.html">release candidate</a>, that allowed us to
identify and resolve quite a few bugs, such as
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10862">#10862</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10809">#10809</a>, and
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10784">#10784</a>. We will be writing regression tests for some
of these bugs, in particular the persistence -related ones
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10834">#10834</a> and <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10840">#10840</a>).</p>

<p>Tails 2.0 <a href="../../../../news/version_2.0.en.html">was released</a> on January 26, as planned.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index5h1"></a>E. Release management</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="../../../../news/version_2.0.en.html">Tails 2.0</a> was released on 2016-01-26:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tails now uses the <span class="application">GNOME Shell</span> desktop
environment, in its <span class="application">Classic</span> mode.
<span class="application">GNOME Shell</span> provides a modern, simple, and
actively developed desktop environment. The <span class="application">Classic</span>
mode keeps the traditional <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>,
<span class="guimenu">Places</span> menu, and windows list. Accessibility and
non-Latin input sources are also better integrated.</li>
<li>Debian 8 upgrades most included software, for example:

<ul>
<li>Many core GNOME utilities from 3.4 to 3.14:
<span class="application">Files</span>,
<span class="application">Disks</span>,
<span class="application">Videos</span>, etc.</li>
<li><span class="application">LibreOffice</span> from 3.5 to 4.3</li>
<li><span class="application">PiTiVi</span> from 0.15 to 0.93</li>
<li><span class="application">Git</span> from 1.7.10 to 2.1.4</li>
<li><span class="application">Poedit</span> from 1.5.4 to 1.6.10</li>
<li><span class="application">Liferea</span> from 1.8.6 to 1.10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update <span class="application">Tor Browser</span> to 5.5 (based on Firefox 38.6.0 ESR):

<ul>
<li>Add Japanese support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove the Windows camouflage which is currently broken in GNOME Shell.</li>
<li>Change to <code>systemd</code> as init system and use it to:

<ul>
<li>Sandbox many services using Linux namespaces and make them harder to exploit.</li>
<li>Make the launching of Tor and the memory wipe on shutdown more robust.</li>
<li>Sanitize our code base by replacing many custom scripts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update most firmware packages which might improve hardware compatibility.</li>
<li>Notify the user if Tails is running from a non-free virtualization software.</li>
<li>Remove <span class="application">Claws Mail</span>, replaced by
<span class="application"><span class="createlink">Icedove</span></span>.</li>
<li>HiDPI displays are better supported. (<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8659">#8659</a>)</li>
<li>Remove the option to open a download with an external application in Tor
Browser as this is usually impossible due to the AppArmor confinement.
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9285">#9285</a>)</li>
<li>Close <span class="application">Vidalia</span> before restarting Tor.</li>
<li>Allow <span class="application">Videos</span> to access the DVD drive.
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10455">#10455</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9990">#9990</a>)</li>
<li>Allow configuring printers without administration password.
(<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8443">#8443</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
