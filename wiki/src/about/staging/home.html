<h1>Tails is a portable operating system that protects your privacy and avoids
censorship.</h1>

</div>

<!--
P3: Portable OS: something like iOS, Android? != mobile. Add "for laptops" somewhere
  - XXX: Have a hero image with a computer?
P4: Does Tails sell the USB stick? Can I use any USB stick?
P5: Can you run your own software on this USB stick?
P5: Is it like Ubuntu?
P9: Lo puedes usar en Windows o en Mac. No vi que funcione también para Linux.
P9: Didn't realize that Tails was an operating system

P1: [DONE] Install Tails on a USB stick and run it on any computer instead of STARTING ON Windows or macOS
P5: [DONE] "Instead of Win/mac" [had to be read twice, sentence structure] reads to them like Tails **only** works with Linux

[[!img avoid.png link="no" alt=""]]

<!--
P6: At first, didn't see the guy walking away from the city
P10: Add mobile phone signal
P11: This is like Google
-->

<h3>Avoid surveillance, censorship, advertising, and viruses</h3>

<p>Tails uses the Tor network to protect your privacy online and avoid
censorship. Enjoy the Internet like it should be.</p>

<!--
P4: What does "No ads" mean? Will news websites start blocking me [ad-blockers]?
P5: *No ads, no viruses* HOW? And is it because there's nothing important of the laptop, so there is no value for hackers?

P2: [DONE] No virus: "because it's Linux"

<div class="col-md-6">

[[!img anywhere.png link="no" alt=""]]

<!--
P10: Would prefer a more robust place than a tent: a bunker!
P11: Tails is like being alone and secure
-->

<h3>Your secure computer anywhere</h3>

<p>To use Tails, shutdown the computer and start on your Tails USB
stick. Tails leaves no trace on the computer when shutting down.</p>

<!--
P4: [WORK] AMAZING that I can use someone else's computer without compromising on security!
P5: [DONE] "Turn your own computer into a secure machine" [had to be read 3-4 times for understanding]. Is it like Vine?
P6: [DONE] Thinks that the image means that your computer can be safe even in a camping

<!--
P6: Thinks that the telephone is tapped by the walkie-talkie
P8: Thinks that the telephone is tapped by the walkie-talkie
P10: Doesn't see much relation with the picture because displayed tools are not digital
P10: Camping kit transmits more independence and autonomy. La seguridad te la vas a proporcionar tu.
P10: Exploration kit son más cosas aisladas. Camping kit es más coecionada: funciono de esta manera
P11: It's about hiking. You are hard to follow and find
P12: Prefiere la primera porque son herramientas de comunicacion
P12: The camping kit doesn't seem related so much to the topic

<h3>Digital security toolbox</h3>

<p>Tails includes tools to work on sensitive documents and communicate
securely. Everything in Tails is ready-to-use and secure by default.</p>

<!--
P4: [DONE] *Toolbox* - can I access Google Docs? What are these tools?
P5: [DONE] *Toolbox* is this software written by Tails? Someone else? Who chose what to include, is it trustworthy?
P2: [DONE] "Which tools?"

[[!img gift-heart.png link="no" alt=""]]

<!--
P9: Likes the heart better, made with love. Doesn't like always relating to money. Without heart is less cheesy.
P10: Prefers with price because it's the most obvious.
P10: Gets the lace but wonders whether it's clear
P10: Likes better with the heart than without because it carries more message of allowing people to escape the commercialization of data
P12: Thinks that "Free Software" is "the normal stuff" (not Tails)
P12: Camping kit feels more like you are going to stay for a bit longer
P12: The price tag feels like it's a something pricee, also because of the lines
P12: Likes better the 1st one because it's not only about the price but also care and safety

P6: [DONE] Thinks that the blueprint represents the act of coding.
P7: [DONE] Thinks that the blueprint represents non-recreational software.

<h3>Free Software</h3>

<p>You can download Tails for free and security researchers can verify our
work. Tails is based on Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

<!--
P4: The free software box is also slightly repetitive; maybe just add "free software" to the first sentence?

P5: [DONE] Who are independent researchers? Does it just mean everyone/all developers?
P9: Unclear about who are the 'security researchers', los desarrolladores de Tails?
