<p>
Tails is a [[!wikipedia desc="live operating system" Live_USB]] that
you can start on almost any computer from a USB stick or a DVD.
</p>

<p>
It aims at preserving your <strong>privacy</strong> and
<strong>anonymity</strong>, and helps you to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>use the Internet anonymously</strong> and <strong>circumvent
    censorship</strong>;<br />
    all connections to the Internet are forced to go through [[the Tor
    network|https://www.torproject.org/]];
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>leave no trace</strong> on the computer you are using unless
    you ask it explicitly;
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools</strong> to encrypt your
    files, emails and instant messaging.
  </li>
</ul>
