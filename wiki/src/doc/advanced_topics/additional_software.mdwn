[[!meta title="Install additional software"]]

Tails includes a
[[coherent but limited set of applications|doc/about/features]]. More
applications can be installed as on any Debian system. Only
applications that are packaged for Debian can be installed. To know if an application
is packaged for Debian, and to find the name of the corresponding software packages, you can search for it in the
[[Debian package directory|https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages]].

Since Tails is amnesic, any additional software package needs to be reinstalled in each working
session. To install the same software packages automatically at the beginning of every working session use the
[[<span class="guilabel">Additional software packages</span> persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]] instead.

To install additional software packages:

1. [[Set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]]
2. in a terminal, type "sudo apt-get update" and enter
3. once the update is finished, type "sudo apt-get install $software"
  (replace $software with the name of the package in Debian) and enter

<p>You can also write multiple packages names to install them at the same
time. If a package has dependencies, those will be installed
automatically.

Software that use the network need to be configured to go through Tor.

<div class="caution">

<p>The software included in Tails go through testing, to make sure they
don't break the security features. Installing other software might
compromise the security that Tails provides, so you should be careful
with what you install.
