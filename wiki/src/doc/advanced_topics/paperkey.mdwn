[[!meta title="Backing up OpenPGP secret keys on paper using paperkey"]]

*[Paperkey](http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/)* is a command
line utility to export OpenPGP secret keys in a format suitable for
printing on paper.

Paper can be destroyed easily but it also has amazingly long retention
qualities, far longer than the magnetic or optical media that are
generally used to back up computer data. So *paperkey* can be useful in
combination with other backup strategies.

<div class="note">

<p>Your OpenPGP key as exported by <span
class="application">paperkey</span> is still protected by your
passphrase.</p>

To learn how to use *paperkey*, read the [documentation on the
*paperkey* website](http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/).

For example, to export an OpenPGP secret key using *paperkey*, execute
the following command, replacing `[keyid]` with the ID of the key that
you want to export:

    gpg --export-secret-key [keyid] | paperkey | gedit
