<p>Most files contain metadata which are information characterising the data itself.
For example:

<ul>
<li>Cameras record data about when and where a picture was taken and what
camera was used.</li>
<li>Office documents automatically add author
and company information to texts and spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't
forget to clean them before publishing: the <span
class="application"><a href="https://mat.boum.org">MAT</a></span> is
the tool for that.</p>
