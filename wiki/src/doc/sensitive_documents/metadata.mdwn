<div class="caution">

Most documents have metadata (informations about the files themselves:
cameras record data about when and where a picture was taken and what
camera was used; documents like pdf or Office automatically add author
and company information to documents and spreadsheets; etc.). Don't
forget to clean them before publishing: the <span

the tool for that.
