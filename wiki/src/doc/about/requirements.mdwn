[[!meta title="System requirements"]]

Tails works on most recent computers less than 10 years old.
Here is a detailed list of requirements:

- Either **an internal or external DVD reader** or the possibility to **boot from a USB stick**.
- Tails requires a 64-bit <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia x86-64]]</span>
  compatible processor: **<span class="definition">[[!wikipedia
  IBM_PC_compatible]]</span>** and others but not <span
  class="definition">[[!wikipedia PowerPC]]</span> nor <span
  class="definition">[[!wikipedia ARM_architecture desc="ARM"]]</span>. Mac computers are IBM PC
  compatible since 2006. Tails does **not** run on most tablets and phones.
- **2 GB of RAM** to work smoothly. Tails is known to work with less memory
  but you might experience strange behaviours or crashes.

<p>Tails might not work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some older computers, for example if they don't have enough
RAM.</li>
<li>Some newer computers, for example if their [[graphics card is
not compatible with Linux|support/known_issues/graphics]].</li>
</ul>
