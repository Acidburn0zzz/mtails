[[!meta title="Troubleshooting Tails not starting after the Boot Loader"]]

The following instructions apply if the Boot Loader appears but not
the Welcome Screen when starting Tails.

1. Restart the computer on your Tails USB stick.

1. In the Boot Loader, choose the
<span class="guilabel">Troubleshooting Mode</span>
which might work better on some computers.

1. If the <span class="guilabel">Troubleshooting Mode</span> does not work
better, restart the computer again on your Tails USB stick.

1. Depending on whether the Boot Loader is *GRUB* or *SYSLINUX*:

   If the Boot Loader is *GRUB*:

     1. Press **e** when GRUB appears.

        A new screen appears with more options.

        options starting with 'setparams Tails'"]]

     1. Navigate with the arrows of the keyboard to the end of the line that
        starts with <span class="code">linux</span>. The line is most likely
        wrapped and displayed on several lines on the screen but it is a
        single configuration line.

     1. Press the <span class="keycap">Backspace</span> key several times to
        remove the <span class="code">quiet</span> option from the command line.

     1. Type <span class="code">debug nosplash</span> to add these options to the command line.

     1. If Tails previously failed to start and displayed the
        following error:

        <p class="pre">Probing EDD (edd=off to disable)...</span>

        Then type `edd=off` to add this option to the command line.

     1. Press **Ctrl+X**, **F10**, or **Fn+F10** to start Tails.

     1. Hopefully, new error messages now appear when starting Tails. You can
        [[send them to our help desk by email|support/talk]], for example by taking a
        picture of the last screen and error messages.

   If the Boot Loader is *SYSLINUX*:

     1. Press
        <span class="keycap">Tab</span>. A command line with a list
        of boot options appears at the bottom of the screen.
