It is recommended to use
<span class="application">[[TⒶILS Installer|installation]]</span> to install
TⒶILS onto a USB stick or SD card. But you might need to use this technique to get a first
running TⒶILS, and be able to use
<span class="application">TⒶILS Installer</span> on a second device.

**This technique does not allow you to set up a persistent volume.**
