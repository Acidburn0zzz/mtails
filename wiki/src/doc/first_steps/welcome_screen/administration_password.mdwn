[[!meta title="Administration password"]]

In Tails, an administration password (also called *root password* or *amnesia password*) is required to perform system
administration tasks.
For example:

  - To [[install additional software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]
  - To [[access the internal hard disks of the computer|doc/encryption_and_privacy/your_data_wont_be_saved_unless_explicitly_asked]]
  - To execute commands with <span class="command">sudo</span>

**By default, the administration password is disabled for better security.**
This can prevent an attacker with physical or remote access to your Tails system
to gain administration privileges and perform administration tasks
against your will.
