Which additional software can I install in Tails?
=================================================

Tails includes a [[limited set of applications|doc/about/features]], but more
software can be installed.
This software is distributed in packages that are made available from the Debian repositories,
which are similar to an app store.

### How to search for packages?

 * Browse locally with
   the <span class="application">Synaptic Package Manager</span>:

   To do so, open Synaptic from <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Synaptic Package Manager.</span>
   </span>

   When you open Synaptic, it reloads the fresh lists of software packages
   from the Debian servers. Let it finish, so you install with the most updated information.

   You can browse the packages by sections from the left sidebar, or search from
   the top 'Search' button on the titles and descriptions.

* Search the Internet for, as an example: 'debian alternatives to photoshop'

* Ask a friend who is knowledgable about Linux.

* You can also search on [the Debian website](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages)


Being careful about what you install
------------------------------------

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages included in Tails are carefully tested for security.
Installing additional packages might break their security, so be
careful with what you install.</p>

</div>

If you are not sure:

 * Most additional software requires extra configuration to be able to connect
   to the network through Tor, and will not work otherwise.
 * Some software might, for example, modify the firewall and break the security
   built in Tails, but a drawing program is less likely to have this problems.
 * Software not officially included in Tails is not tested for security, and
   we cannot provide support or documentation about it.
 * Only applications that are packaged for Debian can be installed, and they are
   under [[extensive scrutiny|doc/about/trust#trust_debian]].

Installing additional software
==============================

When you find a package you want to try, you can install it with <span class="application">
Synaptic</span>:

 - Search for the package name
 - Right click on it and select <span class="guimenuitem">Mark it for
   installation</span>. <span class="application">Synaptic</span> then
   selects the additional required changes for your package to work, and ask you
   to mark those changes as well.
 - Once you are done selecting the packages, you can click on the <span class="button">Apply</span> button.
 - <span class="application">Synaptic</span> then downloads, installs and
   configures all the packages.

If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use `apt` instead.

Installing additional software automatically when starting Tails
----------------------------------------------------------------

To use this feature, you need to enable the [[<span class="guilabel">Additional
software packages</span> persistence feature|persistence/configure#additional_software]].

A message appears asking if you want this packages to be installed
**each time you start Tails** from now on.

XXX - screenshot

If you click on 'Add to Persistent Storage', they install each time
you start Tails, and they will also update automatically when you get online.

If you click on 'Only Once', the downloaded packages stay on your Persistent Storage
and you will be able to reinstall them quickly (without having to download
again, at least until next update).


Removing additional software
============================

If you clicked 'Only Once' after installing a package, it will be gone after
you **restart Tails**.

If your package is part of Additional Software, you can remove it with:

 - <span class="application">Synaptic</span>
   - Search for the package name
   - Right click on the package and select <span class="guimenuitem">Mark for removal</span>, or  <span
   class="guimenuitem">Mark for complete removal</span> if you don't think you
   are going to install it again.
 - From the command line using <span class="application">apt</span>.

After you uninstall the package, a menu will appear asking if you want to remove it.

Checking your list of additional software
-----------------------------------------

If you want to see which software packages you have currently set to install on
each Tails session, open: <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Additional Software</span>
   </span>

It is also available from the Configure Persistent Volume menu, by clicking on the
[[!img lib/emblem-system.png link="no" alt="gears icon"]] button inside the Additional
Software section.

Freeing space in your persistent storage
----------------------------------------

If you installed many packages, you can free space on your Tails USB stick
running this command from a terminal (you will need administration rights):

    apt clean

Configuring additional APT repositories  (for advanced users)
=============================================================

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages included in Tails are carefully tested for security.
Configuring additional APT repositories might break the security built in Tails.
Be careful with what you install.</p>

</div>

Sometimes, you might need to configure additional APT repositories. For
example, to install packages from the `non-free` section of Debian. To do so:

1. Create a <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder in your
   persistent volume:

       sudo install -d -m 755 /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d

1. Edit <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/persistence.conf</span>,
   the configuration of the persistent volume, as root and add the
   <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder as a persistence
   feature of type `link`:

       /etc/apt/sources.list.d	source=apt-sources.list.d,link

1. Write your additional `sources.list` files in the
   <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder. For example, to add
   the `non-free` sections of Debian Jessie, backports, and security
   updates, you can create a file named
   <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list</span>
   with the following content:

       deb tor+http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie non-free
       deb tor+http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports non-free
       deb tor+http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates non-free

   File names must end with
   <span class="filename">.list</span> and may only contain the following
   characters: letters, digits, underscore, hyphen, and period.

1. Correct the ownership and permissions of your additional `sources.list`
   files to be owned by `root` and only readable by others. For
   example:

       chown root:root /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list
       chmod 644 /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list

1. Restart Tails to apply the changes.

When this feature is enabled, a list of
[[additional software|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software]] of
your choice is automatically installed at the beginning of every
working session. The corresponding software packages are stored in the
persistent volume. They are automatically upgraded for security after
a network connection is established.
