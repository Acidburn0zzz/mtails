Which additional software can I install in Tails?
=================================================

Tails includes a
[[coherent but limited set of applications|doc/about/features]]. More
applications can be installed as on any Debian system.
This software packages are made available from the Debian Repositories,
which are similar to an App Store, and they can be browsed locally with
the <span class="application">Synaptic Package Manager</span>.

To do so, open Synaptic from <span class="menuchoice">
<span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
<span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
<span class="guimenuitem">Synaptic Package Manager</span>
</span>.

Probably, when you open Synaptic it will reload the fresh lists of software packages
from the Debian servers. If it does not do so, it may be a good idea to click on the
<span class="button">Reload</span> button. Let it finish, so you install with the most updated information.

You can browse the packages by sections from the left sidebar, or search from
the top 'Search' button on the titles and descriptions. Once you find a package you want to try, you
can right click it and mark it for installation. Once you are done selecting you can click on
the <span class="button">Apply</span> button.

To find good applications, you can also search the Internet for, as an example:
'debian alternatives to photoshop', o you can maybe ask your tech savvy friends.

Only applications that are packaged for Debian can be installed.

Being careful about what you install

<div class="caution">

<strong>Installing additional software is at your own risk.</strong>
Most additional software requires extra configuration to be able to
connect to the network through Tor, and will not work otherwise. Some other software might, for
example, modify the firewall and break the security built in Tails.
Software not officially included in Tails is not tested for security.

</div>

<div class="tip">

<p>Packages that use the network need to be configured to go through Tor. They are otherwise blocked from accessing the network.</p>

Installing additional software
==============================

Installing additional software automatically when starting Tails
----------------------------------------------------------------

Since Tails is amnesic, any additional software package needs to be reinstalled in each working
session. To install the same software packages automatically at the beginning of every working session use the
[[<span class="guilabel">Additional software packages</span> persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]] instead.

Sometimes, you might need to configure additional APT repositories. For
example, to install packages from the `non-free` section of Debian. To do so:

1. Create a <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder in your
   persistent volume:

       sudo install -d -m 755 /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d

1. Edit <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/persistence.conf</span>,
   the configuration of the persistent volume, as root and add the
   <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder as a persistence
   feature of type `link`:

       /etc/apt/sources.list.d	source=apt-sources.list.d,link

1. Write your additional `sources.list` files in the
   <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder. For example, to add
   the `non-free` sections of Debian Jessie, backports, and security
   updates, you can create a file named
   <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list</span>
   with the following content:

       deb tor+http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie non-free
       deb tor+http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports non-free
       deb tor+http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates non-free

   File names must end with
   <span class="filename">.list</span> and may only contain the following
   characters: letters, digits, underscore, hyphen, and period.

1. Correct the ownership and permissions of your additional `sources.list`
   files to be owned by `root` and only readable by others. For
   example:

       chown root:root /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list
       chmod 644 /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list

1. Restart Tails to apply the changes.

When this feature is enabled, a list of
[[additional software|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software]] of
your choice is automatically installed at the beginning of every
working session. The corresponding software packages are stored in the
persistent volume. They are automatically upgraded for security after
a network connection is established.
