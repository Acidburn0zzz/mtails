Which additional software can I install in Tails?
=================================================

Tails includes a [[limited set of applications|doc/about/features]] but more
software can be installed.
This software is distributed in packages that are made available from the Debian repositories,
which are similar to an app store.

To know which packages are available in Debian:

- Browse locally with
  the <span class="application">Synaptic Package Manager</span>:

  1. To open <span class="application">Synaptic</span>, choose <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Synaptic Package Manager.</span>
     </span>

  2. Wait until <span class="application">Synaptic</span> finishes downloading new package information
     from the Debian servers.

  3. You can:

     - Browse the packages by sections from the left sidebar.

     - Search on titles and descriptions of packages with the <span class="button">Search</span> button.

- Search the Internet for alternatives to other software.

  For example: "*debian alternatives to photoshop*".

- Ask a friend who is knowledgeable about Linux.

- Search the [Debian website](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages).

Being careful about what you install
------------------------------------

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages included in Tails are carefully tested for security.
Installing additional packages might break the security built in Tails, so be
careful with what you install.</p>

</div>

If you are unsure:

- Packages that use the network need to be configured to go through
  Tor. They are otherwise blocked from accessing the network.

- Some software might, for example, modify the firewall and break the security
  built in Tails. But other software like games or office tools are probably fine.

- Software not [[officially included in Tails|about/doc/features]] might have not been tested for security.
  We also cannot provide support or documentation about it.

- Only applications that are packaged for Debian can be installed and they are
  under [[extensive scrutiny|doc/about/trust#trust_debian]].

Installing additional software
==============================

To install a package using <span class="application">Synaptic</span>:

- Click <span class="button">Search</span> to search for the name of the package.

- Right-click on the name of the package in the search results and choose <span class="guimenuitem">Mark for
  installation</span>.

- <span class="application">Synaptic</span> selects the additional changes for your package to work.

4. Click <span class="button">Mark</span> to confirm those changes.

- Click <span class="button">Apply</span> to download, install, and
  configure the package.

If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use the <span class="command">apt</span> command instead.

Installing additional software automatically when starting Tails
----------------------------------------------------------------

To use this feature, you need to enable the [[<span class="guilabel">Additional
Software</span> persistence feature|persistence/configure#additional_software]].

After a package is installed using <span class="application">Synaptic</span> or
<span class="command">apt</span>, a menu asks if you want to install this package
each time you start Tails from now on.

[[!img additional_software/add-additional-software.png link=no alt="Additional Software question menu"]]

- If you choose <span class="button">Install Only Once</span>, the package will stay on your Persistent Volume
  and can be reinstalled faster without having to download it
  again for some time.

- If you choose <span class="button">Add to Persistent Storage</span>, the package will be installed each time
  you start Tails. Packages are also updated automatically when you get online.

Removing additional software
============================

If you clicked 'Only Once' after installing a package, you can remove it simply **restarting Tails**.

If your package is part of Additional Software, you can remove it with:

- <span class="application">Synaptic</span>

  - Search for the package name

  - Right click on the package and select <span class="guimenuitem">Mark for removal</span>, or  <span
  class="guimenuitem">Mark for complete removal</span> if you don't think you
  are going to install it again.

- From the command line using <span class="application">apt</span>.

After you uninstall the package, a menu appears asking if you want to remove it from Additional Software.

Checking your list of additional software
-----------------------------------------

If you want to see which software packages you have currently set to install on
each Tails session, open: <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Additional Software</span>
   </span>

It is also available from the Configure Persistent Volume menu, by clicking on the
[[!img lib/emblem-system.png link="no" alt="gears icon"]] button inside the Additional
Software section.

Freeing space in your persistent storage
----------------------------------------

If you installed many packages, you can free space on your Tails USB stick:

- Open a Root Terminal:  <span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
  </span>

- Run the command: <span class="command">apt clean</span>

Configuring additional APT repositories  (for advanced users)
=============================================================

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages included in Tails are carefully tested for security.
Configuring additional APT repositories might break the security built in Tails.
Be careful with what you install.</p>

</div>

Sometimes, you might need to configure additional APT repositories. For
example, to install packages from the `non-free` section of Debian. To do so:

1. Create an <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder in your
   persistent volume:

       sudo install -d -m 755 /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d

1. Edit <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/persistence.conf</span>,
   the configuration of the persistent volume, as root and add the
   <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder as a persistence
   feature of type `link`:

       /etc/apt/sources.list.d	source=apt-sources.list.d,link

1. Write your additional `sources.list` files in the
   <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder. For example, to add
   the `non-free` sections of Debian Jessie, backports, and security
   updates, you can create a file named
   <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list</span>
   with the following content:

       deb tor+http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie non-free
       deb tor+http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports non-free
       deb tor+http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates non-free

   File names must end with
   <span class="filename">.list</span> and may only contain the following
   characters: letters, digits, underscore, hyphen, and period.

1. Correct the ownership and permissions of your additional `sources.list`
   files to be owned by `root` and only readable by others. For
   example:

       chown root:root /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list
       chmod 644 /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list

1. Restart Tails to apply the changes.

When this feature is enabled, a list of
[[additional software|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software]] of
your choice is automatically installed at the beginning of every
working session. The corresponding software packages are stored in the
persistent volume. They are automatically upgraded for security after
a network connection is established.
