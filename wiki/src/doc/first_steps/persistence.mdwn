[[!meta title="Encrypted persistence"]]

If you start Tails from a USB stick, you can create a
persistent volume in the free space left on the USB stick.
The files in the persistent
volume are saved encrypted and remain available across separate working sessions.

You can use this persistent volume to store any of the following:

  - Personal files
  - Some settings
  - Additional software
  - Encryption keys

The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase.

Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not
each time you start Tails.
