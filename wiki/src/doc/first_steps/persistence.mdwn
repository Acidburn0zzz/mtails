[[!meta title="Encrypted Persistent Storage"]]

If you start Tails from a USB stick, you can create a
Persistent Storage in the free space left on the USB stick.
The files in the Persistent
Storage are saved encrypted and remain available across separate working sessions.

You can use this Persistent Storage to store any of the following:

  - Personal files
  - Some settings
  - Additional software
  - Encryption keys

The Persistent Storage is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase.

Once the Persistent Storage is created, you can choose to unlock it or not
each time you start Tails.
