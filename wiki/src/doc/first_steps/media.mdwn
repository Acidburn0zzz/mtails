[[!meta title="Choosing between installing onto a USB stick and burning a DVD"]]

DVD
===

  - DVDs are read-only so your Tails can't be altered by a virus or an attacker.
  - DVDs are cheap but you will need to burn a new DVD each time you update your version of Tails.
  - You could also use a DVD-RW but those are not read-only.

USB stick
=========

  - An attacker with physical access to your USB stick or through a virus could
    alter your Tails.
  - USB sticks can be upgraded to future versions of Tails.
  - You can use [[persistence|doc/first_steps/persistence]] and store your
    documents and configuration in an encrypted persistent volume on the same
    USB stick.
  - USB sticks are smaller to fit in your pocket.
  - Some older computers might not be able to start from a USB stick.
  - Some USB sticks have a read-only switch that can prevent your Tails from
    being altered, but be aware that this protection is most probably not
    ensured by the USB stick itself: do not rely on untrusted computers to respect
    this feature.
