[[!meta title="Rescuing your Persistent Storage"]]

<!-- TODO: Explain when these instructions apply. -->

1. Install Tails on a new USB stick on which you want to rescue your Persistent
   Storage. Make sure that this new USB stick is at least
   as large as your current Tails USB stick.

1. Start on your new Tails and create a Persistent Storage on it.
   For detailed instructions, see how to
   [[create and configure a Persistent Storage|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]].
   When the Persistent Storage settings shows the list of possible features,
   click **Save** and exit.

   The process described below overrides the configuration of the Persistent
   Storage. So, it does not matter which features you turn on when creating
   the Persistent Storage.

1. Restart on your new Tails, set up an [[administration
   password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]], and
   unlock the Persistent Storage.

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Files</span></span>
   to open the <span class="application">Files</span> browser.

1. Plug in your USB stick that has your broken Tails. A new
   encrypted volume appears in the sidebar of the
   <span class="application">Files</span> browser. Click on it and enter the
   passphrase of your broken Tails to unlock the volume.

   The Persistent Storage of your broken Tails shows up as
   <span class="guilabel">TailsData</span>.

   <div class="note">
   <p>If an encrypted volume does not appear, then you might not be able to
   rescue the Persistent Storage of your broken Tails.</p>
   </div>

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
   </span>
   to open a terminal with administration rights.

1. Execute the following command to rescue the Persistent Storage of your
   broken Tails USB stick to your new Tails USB stick:

<!-- TODO: Test this command. -->
<p class="pre command root">rsync -PaSHAXv --del /media/amnesia/TailsData/ /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked</p>

When the command finishes, it displays a summary of the data that was copied. For example:

<pre>
sent 32.32M bytes  received 1.69K bytes  21.55M bytes/sec
total size is 32.30M  speedup is 1.00
</pre>

You can now eject the <span class="guilabel">TailsData</span> in the
<span class="application">Files</span> browser and unplug your Tails USB stick
that has a broken Persistent Storage.
