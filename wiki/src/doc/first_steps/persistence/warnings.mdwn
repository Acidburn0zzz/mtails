Storing sensitive documents
===========================

**The persistent volume is not hidden.** An attacker in possession of
your USB stick can know that there is a persistent volume on it. Take into consideration
that you can be forced or tricked to give out its passphrase.

Read also our instructions to [[securely delete the persistent volume|delete]].

Overwriting configurations
==========================

The programs included in Tails are carefully configured with security in
mind. If you use the persistence volume to overwrite the configuration
of the programs included in Tails, it can break this security or render
these programs unusable.

Be especially careful when using the
[[Dotfiles|persistence/configure#dotfiles]] feature.

Furthermore, the anonymity of Tor and Tails relies on making it harder to
distinguish one Tails user from another. <strong>Changing the default
configurations can break your anonymity.</strong>

<a id="minimum"></a>

Use to the minimum
==================

**Use the persistent volume only when necessary and to the minimum.** It is
always possible to start Tails without activating the persistent volume. All the
features of the persistent volume are optional and need to be explicitly
activated. Only the files and folders that you specify are saved.

<a id="open_other_systems"></a>

Opening the persistent volume from other operating systems
==========================================================

**It is possible to
open the persistent volume from other operating systems. But, doing so might
compromise the security provided by Tails.**

For example, image thumbnails might be created and saved by the other
operating system. Or, the contents of files might be indexed by the other
operating system.

Other operating systems should probably not be trusted to handle
sensitive information or leave no trace.
