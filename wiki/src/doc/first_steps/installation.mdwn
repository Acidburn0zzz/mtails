[[!meta title="Installing on a USB stick"]]

Tails includes <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>: a custom
installer for USB sticks.

<div class="tip">

<p>Using <span class="application">Tails Installer</span> allows you to
later [[create a persistent volume|persistence]] in the free space
left on the USB stick.</p>

</div>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="application">Tails Installer</span> can only install Tails on a
USB stick of <strong>at least 4 GB</strong>.</p>

</div>

<div class="note">

<p>Tails requires a dedicated USB stick. It is impossible to add
another operating system or partition on the same USB stick if you want to benefit
from [[automatic upgrades|upgrade]] or create a [[persistent encrypted volume|persistence]].</p>

</div>

For the moment, <span class="application">Tails Installer</span> is only
available from inside Tails. So you need to start Tails on a first
USB stick or DVD, and later clone it on a USB stick.

1. Get a first Tails running. To do so you can either:

   - Start Tails on a [[Tails DVD|dvd]] (recommended).
   - Start Tails on another Tails USB stick, for example from a
     friend.
   - [[Manually install Tails on another USB stick|installation/manual]]
     and start *Tails Installer* from it.

2. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Tails Installer</span>
   </span>
   to start <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>.

3. To install on a new USB stick, click on the <span class="button">Clone &
   Install</span> button.

4. Plug the USB stick on which you want to install Tails.

   A new device, which corresponds to the USB, appears in the
   <span class="guilabel">Target Device</span> drop-down list.

5. Choose this new device from the <span class="guilabel">Target Device</span>
   drop-down list.

   <div class="caution">

   <ul>
   <li><strong>All the data on the installed USB stick will be
   lost.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>This operation does not [[securely
   delete|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]] the lost data on the
   installed USB stick.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>This operation does not copy the persistent volume of the
   USB stick which is being cloned.</strong></li>
   </ul>

   </div>

6. To start the installation, click on the <span
   class="button">Install Tails</span> button.

7. Read the warning message in the pop-up window. Click on the <span
   class="button">Yes</span> button to confirm.

<div class="next">

<p>After the installation completes, you can [[start Tails|start_tails]]
on this new USB stick.</p>
