Sometimes, after an automatic upgrade, your Tails might either:

- Fail to start. Often after the message:

  <pre>Loading, please wait...</pre>

- Behave weirdly. For example, your keyboard does not work or you cannot
  connect to a network.

To fix this problem, you can [[update your Tails
manually|doc/first_steps/upgrade/#manual]].

Note that your Persistent Volume will be safely preserved.
