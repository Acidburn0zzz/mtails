[[!meta title="Voice chatting with Mumble"]]

For voice chatting, <span class="application">Tails Server</span> includes <span
class="application">Mumble-Server</span>.

For more detailed documentation, refer to the [official
<span class="application">Mumble</span>
documentation](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/FAQ).


Configure the Service
=====================

The <span class="application">Mumble-Server</span> is preconfigured in <span class="application">Tails Server</span>, so you are able to start it without additional configuration. You can edit the configuration options by clicking the **Edit** button on the bottom right.

Mumble specific options:
1. Password: The password required to connect to the service. This is preset to a 20 character random string.
2. TLS Fingerprint: This is the SHA-1 digest of the TLS certificate used by the Mumble server. You should provide this to the clients so they can verify the certificate when they connect. This option can't be modified.
3. Welcome Message: This message will be displayed to clients when they connect to the service.

The other options are explained in the [[Tails Server main documentation|tails_server/tails_server]].


Connect to the Service
======================

If you are using Tails, you can use the <span class="application">Connect to Tails Server</span> application. Open <span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Connect to Tails Server</span>
</span>.

You can also connect by using the <span class="application">Mumble</span> client and entering the address, port and password manually. To connect to the service, start <span class="application">Mumble</span> and choose <span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Server</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Connect</span>
</span>, and then click <span class="guimenuitem">Add New</span>. Now you need to enter the onion address and the port (defaults to 64738). You will also need to choose a label for the service and a username. When you click OK, the client will try to connect to the service and will ask you to enter the service's password.

Verify Certificate
==================
When connecting to the service manually, there will be a prompt informing you that there are errors with the TLS certificate (it's host name doesn't match and it is self-signed) and asking you if you want to accept the certificate. You should compare the displayed certificate fingerprint with the fingerprint in the in <span class="application">Tails Server</span> and only accept the certificate if they match. If you do not have the TLS fingerprint, ask the <span class="application">Tails Server</span> administrator for it.
