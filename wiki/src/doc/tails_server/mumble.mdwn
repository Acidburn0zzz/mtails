[[!meta title="Voice chatting with Mumble"]]

For voice chatting, <span class="application">Tails Server</span> includes <span
class="application">Mumble-Server</span>. 

For more detailed documentation, refer to the [official
<span class="application">Mumble</span>
documentation](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/FAQ).

Configure the Service
=====================

The <span class="application">Mumble-Server</span> is preconfigured in <span class="application">Tails Server</span>, so you are able to start it without additional configuration. You might still want to configure some of the service's options:

1. Password: The password required to connect to the service. This is preset to a 20 character random string.

1. Persistence: Stores the service's configuration persistently (i.e. it will not be reset after rebooting Tails). This is only available if you enabled [[Tails' persistence feature|first_steps/persistence]].

1. Autostart: Starts this service automatically after boot.

1. Allow LAN: Allows connection from your local area network (LAN) to the service. 

   <div class="tip">
   <p>To connect locally, you will have to find out which IP address your computer is assigned to on your local network. You can look this up in the <span class="application">Network</span> application. To start <span class="application">Network</span>, open <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Settings</span>
   </span>, and then choose <span class="guimenuitem">Network</span>.
   </div>


Connect to the Service
======================

You can connect to the <span class="application">Mumble-Server</span> service using the <span class="application">Mumble</span> client. To start <span class="application">Mumble</span>, open
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Mumble</span>
</span>.
In order to connect to the service, you will need the onion address, the port, and the password. This information can be easily distributed by the service administrator by copying the <em>Connection Info</em> displayed in <span class="application">Tails Server</span>.

To connect to the service, choose <span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Server</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Connect</span>
</span>, and then click <span class="guimenuitem">Add New</span>. Now you need to enter the onion address and the port (defaults to 64738). You will also need to choose a label for the service and a username. When you click OK, the client will try to connect to the service and will ask you to enter the service's password.

Verify Certificate
==================
When connecting to the service for the first time, there will be a prompt informing you that there are errors with the certificate (it's host name doesn't match and it is self-signed) and asking you if you want to accept the certificate. You should compare the displayed certificate fingerprint with the fingerprint in the <em>Connection Info</em> in <span class="application">Tails Server</span> and only accept the certificate if they match. If you do not have this <em>Connection Info</em>, ask the <span class="application">Tails Server</span> administrator for it.
