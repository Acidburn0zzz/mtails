[[!meta title="Manage OpenPGP keys and SSH keys"]]

<span class="application">Passwords and Keys</span> creates and stores
security tokens, helping to keep your information secure on your
computer, and secure when you send information over a network.

Using <span class="application">Passwords and Keys</span>, you can:

* Copy and save passwords that are difficult to remember. To group
  related passwords, create keyrings. Tails also ships
  [[KeePassX|doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords]] to manage
  passwords.
* Create and manage OpenPGP keys.
* Create and manage SSH keys.

To start <span class="application">Passwords and Keys</span> choose
