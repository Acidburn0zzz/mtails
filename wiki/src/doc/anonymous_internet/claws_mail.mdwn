Email providers
===============

There is no truly "secure" or "anonymous" email service. There are
email providers that can be more or less trusted, but the best
solution is to not rely on them: encrypt emails so curious people
don't have access to the content, create contextual pseudonymous
adresses and encourage your friends to do the same, so the metadata is
less revealing.

We do not recommend any third-party services for your private
communication, be it email, instant messaging or any other kind of
messaging. We consider that it is not the aim of Tails to provide such
information. However, the Riseup collective provides a
[list of autonomous servers](https://help.riseup.net/en/security/resources/radical-servers).

Furthermore, we encourage you to run your own, independent, services.
