<p><strong><span class="application">Electrum</span> in Tails cannot connect
anymore to Electrum servers.</strong></p>

<p>The version of <span class="application">Electrum</span> in Tails is
vulnerable to a <a href="https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/4968">phishing
attack that tricks people in updating to a malicious version of
<span class="application">Electrum</span></a> which is not distributed from the
official Electrum website.</p>

<p><strong>You are safe unless you try to do the malicious update
manually.</strong></p>

<p>To prevent this phishing attack, all trustworthy
<span class="application">Electrum</span> servers now prevent
older versions from connecting to them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, newer versions of <span class="application">Electrum</span>
are not available in Debian and cannot be integrated easily in Tails. Given the
lack of maintenance of Electrum in Debian, we are still

what is best to do in Tails</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, your wallet is not lost and you can restore it from its seed
using an <a href="https://electrum.org/#download">up-to-date version of
Electrum</a> outside of Tails.</p>
