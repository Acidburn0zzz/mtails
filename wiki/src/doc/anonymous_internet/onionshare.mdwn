[[!meta title="Sharing files with OnionShare"]]

Tails includes [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/), a tool for anonymous
file sharing. It allows you to share files and folders directly
from your running Tails. To do so, it's creating a Hidden Service
(a website ending with *.onion*) within the Tor network. Any Tor user who you
decide to give the address to can download the files or folders you
decided to share.

To start <span class="application">OnionShare</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
 <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
 <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
 <span class="guimenuitem">OnionShare</span></span>.


You can add files and folders to share by:

  - right-clicking on a file or folder in the file browser and
    choosing <span class="guilabel">Share with OnionShare</span>

  - dragging and dropping the files and folders from the file browser
    into the free area in the window
    of <span class="application">OnionShare</span>.



Click on <span class="guilabel">Start Sharing</span>. Once the files
are available, an address similar to
*http://bwwijokny5qplq5q.onion/assam-cover* will be shown.

<div class="tip">

By default <span class="application">OnionShare</span> will stop
sharing your added files after the files have been downloaded once.
To allow multiple downloads, you have to uncheck the
check box <span class="guilabel">Stop sharing automatically</span>.

</div>

Once you close the application or shut down Tails, the files
are not shared anymore.
