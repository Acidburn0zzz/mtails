[[!meta title="Logging in to captive portals"]]

Many publicly accessible Internet connections (usually available through a
wireless network connection) require users to first log in to a *captive
portal* in order to access the Internet.

A captive portal is a web page that is displayed to the user before the user
can access the Internet. Captive portals usually require the user to log in to
the network or enter information such as an email address. Captive portals are
commonly encountered at Internet cafés, libraries, airports, hotels, and
universities.

This is an example of a captive portal (by

Tor cannot be started when your Internet connection is initially blocked
by a captive portal. So, Tails includes an
<span class="application">Unsafe Browser</span> to log in to captive
portals before starting Tor.

To start the <span class="application">Unsafe Browser</span>, choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Unsafe Web Browser</span></span>.

The <span class="application">Unsafe Browser</span> has a red theme to
differentiate it from [[<span class="application">Tor Browser</span>|Tor_Browser]].

<div class="caution">

<p><strong>The <span class="application">Unsafe Browser</span> is not
anonymous</strong>. Use it only to log in to captive portals or to
[[browse web pages on the local network|advanced_topics/lan#browser]].</p>

</div>

<div class="note">

Security recommendations:

* Do not run this browser at the same time as the anonymous
  [[<span class="application">Tor Browser</span>|Tor_Browser]]. This makes it easy to not mistake one browser for the
  other, which could have catastrophic consequences.
