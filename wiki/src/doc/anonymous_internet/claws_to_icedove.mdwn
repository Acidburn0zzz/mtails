[[!meta title="Migrating from Claws Mail to Icedove"]]

For reading and writing email, Tails includes <span
class="application">[Icedove](https://wiki.debian.org/Icedove)</span>.
Tails ships Icedove with Torbirdy, an extension which makes sure 
that connections go through Tor.
Furthermore, you will be able to use Enigmail, an easy interface 
for sending and receiving GPG encrypted emails.

If you previously used ClawsMail and have activated its persistence feature,
you are likely to want to migrate your mailboxes to Icedove.

Migrate an IMAP based email account
-----------------------------------

If you use IMAP, your emails are stored on the remote email server.
Thus, you simply need to use Icedove's account creation wizard in order
to be able to retrieve and send your emails through Icedove.

To start <span class="application">Icedove</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Icedove</span>
</span>.

When you start Icedove for the first time, the account creation wizard 
will pop up automatically. Please enter your credentials: name, email address, 
password and chose the protocol, probably IMAP, then click "Continue".

You will be presented the Torbirdy screen, indicating that the next steps will
also need to be manually configured. Click Ok.

The account settings window now presents you with the server settings. Here, 
you will need to adjust the server name, user name and security settings for 
retrieving your email.

Then, you will be able to click on "Outgoing server" and adjust the settings 
for sending email.

One can verify the previous account settings in Claws Mail's Configuration menu.
Fire up Claws Mail, click on Configuration, then account settings, then Edit.

If you need to add multiple accounts, click on Account Actions, then Add Mail Account.

When done, click OK. This will close the Account Settings window.

Enigmail will now ask you if you need help. If you use GPG, you can now either
generate a new encryption key or import one from your Persistent volume.

You can now use Icedove.

For further configuration options please refer to the Icedove documentation XXX.

Migrate a POP based email account
---------------------------------



Export email contacts from Claws to Icedove
-------------------------------------------

In Claws Mail, access the Address book through the main menu "Extras" -> Address book 
or press Shift+Ctrl+A. Select an address book on the left then click on "Extras" -> 
Export LDIF. Select a place where to store the file, then click Next. You do not need
to add a Suffix, so just click Next, then Close.

In Icedove, simply click the Address book icon. In the address book window, click "Tools" 
-> Import, select "Address Books" then click Next. Choose "Text file (LDIF, .tab, .csv, .txt)".
Now click Next and navigate to the file you have saved from Claws Mail. Click Ok, you're done.
