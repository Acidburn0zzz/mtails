Connecting to a service
=======================

Currently, Tails Server enforces the use of Tor's [client authentication](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient). This allows only clients with a so called client cookie to connect to the onion service. This cookie has to be [added to the client's Tor configuration](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#HidServAuth). To make this more user friendly, Tails includes an [[application to connect to Tails Server|tails_server/client_app]], which takes care of the client cookie, and for some services it also takes care of some other things.


Client Authentication Background
----------
The client authentication protects from deanonymization attacks against onion services, which are easier to perform against Tails, because [Tails doesn't use stable guard nodes](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/11732). We plan to make the client authentication optional once the stable guard nodes issue is fixed.
