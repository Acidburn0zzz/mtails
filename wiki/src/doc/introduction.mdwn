[[!meta title="Introduction"]]

The goal of this documentation is to explain how to use TⒶILS and to present to
the user its principal security features. It is structured to help you achieve
concrete tasks, but also provides more general information to help you
understand the type of security provided by TⒶILS and its limitations.

As TⒶILS includes [[many other applications|doc/about/features]], this
documentation focuses on the aspects that are specific to TⒶILS. To learn more
about how to use each specific application, we try to provide references to
external documentation.

But this documentation is not meant to be a complete computer security guide.
Because it does not explain how to build a complete security strategy, that
would depend on your specific use case and threat model.

If you are facing concrete problems with TⒶILS that are not documented here,
refer to our [[Support]] section to get more help.

If you want to learn about the internals of TⒶILS, and understand our design
choices, refer to our [[design documentation|contribute/design]].
