<p>We are asking you to help Tails. You downloaded Tails for free
because we believe that nobody should have to pay to be safe while using
computers. And we want to keep it this way. <span class="highlight">If
everybody using Tails today donated 12â‚¬, our fundraising would be done for
the whole year.</span> We are a very small non-profit and our yearly
budget is ridiculously small compared to the value of Tails. If you
like our work, please take one minute to keep Tails alive.</p>
