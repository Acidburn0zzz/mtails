<p>Today, we are asking you to help Tails. You downloaded Tails for free
because we believe that nobody should have to pay to be safe while using
computers. And we want to keep it this way. <span class="highlight">If
everyone reading this donated $6, our fundraiser would be done by the
end of the day.</span> The price of a USB stick is all we need.</p>

<p>But not everyone can donate. When you do, you are offering to many
others who need it, the very precious tool that is Tails.</p>
