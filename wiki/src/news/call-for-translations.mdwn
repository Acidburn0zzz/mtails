We are happy to announce the launch of our shiny new web based
[translation platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/).

Tails is an out-of-the-box all-rounder tool that aims at helping people
to preserve their privacy and anonymity online. To be most helpful, it comes
with a [public documentation and website](https://tails.boum.org) that
is currently translated into 6 languages besides English: Farsi, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. To help more users at risk around
the world to understand and use Tails, more translations of are welcome
and needed.

This is why we have put enormous effort into setting up an easier way to
translate our documentation: welcome our new [translation
platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/). After creating an account
you can start translating right away! For more details on how to get
started, make sure to read our [[documentation for
translators|/contribute/how/translate/with_translation_platform/]].

We are specifically looking for translations to a
[[languages|/contribute/how/translate/#tier-1-languages]] that we
consider valuable to our user base: Arabic, Farsi, French, German,
Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese,
Spanish, and Turkish.

Please refer to the section [[Getting
help|/contribute/how/translate/with_translation_platform#getting-help]]
if you have further questions or experience technical problems.

Thanks to all hard-working translation teams!
