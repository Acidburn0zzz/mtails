New features
============

We will focus on **improving installation and upgrade**, as we know that
they still cause major difficulties for new users:

- In January, we will release a **brand new installation mechanism** to
  finally make it easy to install Tails on macOS (and also easier on
  Windows and Linux).

- We will add support for **Secure Boot**.

- We will **remove the need for manual upgrades** and make it possible to always
  do automatic upgrades. We will also research lighter and more robust
  upgrades mechanisms.

Adoption
========

- We will redesign our homepage to **explain better what is Tails** to
  new users and why they should use it.

- We will make it much easier to translate our website and train new
  translators, hopefully leading to offering more languages available on
  our website.

Under the hood
==============

- We will upgrade Tails to Debian 10 (Buster), planned for mid 2019.

- As always, most of the day-to-day work that we do is invisible to our
  users and we will tackle many technical migrations in our code and
  infrastructure (Debian 10, Tor Launcher as Web Extension, Jenkins 2,
  Gitolite 3, Java 9, etc.).

- We will contribute the security improvements that we wrote for the
  *Thunderbird* autoconfiguration with *Thunderbird* upstream.

- Thanks to your generous donations, we will finally have a budget
  dedicated to do many more smaller usability improvements everywhere in
  Tails.
