On October 7, we launched our donation campaign by explaining [[why
supporting Tails is more important than ever|news/2019-fundraiser]]. On
October 31, we summarized [[what we did in 2019 to make Tails easier to
adopt by new users|news/achievements_in_2019]]. Today we pass on to you
our plans for 2020.

So far, the donation campaign has been pretty successful. We received
around 50&#8239;000 â‚¬ already, which is 69% more compared to last year.
Still, these good results are due to some very generous donations and
fewer people have been donating so far. We received around 1&#8239;100
donations already, which is 16% less compared to last year.

Less manual upgrades (January 2020)
===================================

Tails has had an automatic upgrade mechanism since 2013. But this
mechanism only works for a limited amount of upgrades, after which a
[["manual" upgrade|doc/upgrade#manual]] is needed.

We know that upgrades are one of your major pain points and users often
think that their Tails is "broken" when automatic upgrades are not
possible anymore.

In 2020, we will make it possible to do automatic upgrades endlessly and
remove the need for most manual upgrades. Manual upgrades might still be needed in rare occasions. We know that even automatic
upgrades are too painful so we will also research ways of making them
lighter and more robust.

New homepage and outreach material (April 2020)
===============================================

To leverage all the work that we have been doing in the past years to
make Tails easier to install and use, in 2020, we will work on
explaining better what is Tails and why people should use it.

The text on our Home and About pages have not changed significantly
since 2011. It is old, too verbose, too technical for most people, and
not engaging visually. Since then Tails has come a long way: the number
of people using Tails has been multiplied by 16. Tails is not anymore an
experimental project for privacy experts but a reference in our field.

For the less technical part of our target audience, Tails is a
technological object like nothing they have used before.  Some of the
core concepts of Tails are particularly new and hard to understand
before using it:

- Tails is a full operating system that is started from a USB stick.
- Tails forgets everything by default.

We will use
[user-centered](https://simplysecure.org/blog/formative-testing) [design
techniques](https://simplysecure.org/blog/branding-tails) and work with
[[professional graphic designers|jobs/illustrations_how_tails_work]] to
make sure that the new explanation makes sense to less tech-savvy
people.

To reach critical communities of users and digital security trainers
worldwide, we will also print outreach materials based on this new
explanation, have it available in 4 languages, and send it to partner
organizations worldwide.

If your organization works with journalists, activists, or
human-defenders worldwide and is interested in receiving leaflets about
Tails in 2020, please <a href="mailto:sajolida@pimienta.org">get in
touch with us</a>.

Secure Boot for better hardware support (July 2020)
===================================================

In 2019, we worked on making it much easier to start Tails on Mac and as
a consequence, the number of people using Tails on Mac more than
doubled.

In 2020, we will add support for Secure Boot, which will make Tails
easier to start on PC, which represents more than 90% of the people who
download Tails.

For years, issues with Secure Boot have been one of the most frequent
issues reported to our help desk and is a major blocker for less
tech-savvy users to adopt Tails.

Currently, many users have to learn how to disable Secure Boot on their
computer. This process is slightly different on every computer, is very
complicated to learn on your own, and can lead to scary problems on
Windows computers, for example [[!tails_ticket 15016#note-19
desc="*BitLocker* asking you for a recovery key"]].

<strong>Next year, we will continue putting a lot of our energy into
making Tails easier to use and outreaching to the people the most in
need of digital security. If you also think that this is important,
please take a moment to donate to Tails.</strong>
