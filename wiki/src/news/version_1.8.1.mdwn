# Known issues

* Automatic upgrades are much slower to apply than before.
  Expect the upgrade to take around an hour *after* the download is
  finished. See [[!tails_ticket 10757]] for details.

See the current list of [[known issues|support/known_issues]].

# Download or upgrade

Go to the [[download]] or [[upgrade|doc/first_steps/upgrade/]] page.

If your TⒶILS does not
boot after an automatic upgrade, please [[upgrade your TⒶILS
manually|doc/first_steps/upgrade#manual]].

# For users of a persistent Electrum Bitcoin client

If you have enabled the <span class="guilabel">Bitcoin client</span>
(<span class="application">Electrum</span>) persistence feature and
have *upgraded* a TⒶILS USB stick installation to Tails 1.8.1, then
please follow these steps in order to make Electrum able to connect
to the network:

1. Make sure <span class="application">Electrum</span> is not running.

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice"><span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Terminal</span></span> to open a terminal.

1. Execute the following command to migrate the configuration:

       echo '{"auto_connect": true, "proxy": "socks5:localhost:9050"}' > ~/.electrum/config
