On October XXX, we started our [[yearly donation
campaign|news/201XXX-fundraiser]]. Today, we summarize what we achieved
with your help in 2019.

If you liked our work in 2019, please take a minute to
donate and make us thrive in 2020!


Easier adoption by new users
============================

This year, we worked on few new features but very important ones as they
make it easier for new users to use Tails for the first time.

- In January, we completely changed the installation methods for Tails.
  Tails is now downloaded as a *USB image*: an image of the data as it
  needs to be written to the USB stick.

  This improved the installation process easier for all operating
  systems but made it especially easier and much faster for less
  tech-savvy users on [[Windows|install/win/usb]] and
  [[macOS|install/mac/usb]].

- We wrote major improvements to our troubleshooting instructions for
  first time users:

  - We explained better how to [[troubleshooting Wi-Fi not working|install/win/usb#wi-fi]],
    which is unfortunately quite common, especially on Mac, and which Wi-FI
    USB adapters work in Tails.

  - We created a [[boot menu animation|install/win/usb#animation]] to explain
    how to start Tails on PC and further improved these troubleshooting
    instructions in general.

As a consequence, more people than ever are using Tails:
 
- Tails is now being downloaded around XXX times a day. That's XXX more than in
  January 2018.

- Tails is now used around XXX times a day. That's XXX more than in August 2018.

- The percentage of people using Tails from macOS more than XXX
  since January 2018.

To continue making Tails always more accessible by more people in the future,
we built a translation platform to make it easier to translate our website.
Since then, people started translating our website into Arabic, Catalan,
Traditional and Simplified Chinese, Polish, Russian, Serbian, and Turkish.

- XXX Curated Greeter if in 4.0?


Maintenance work
================

This year,  we also did a lot of maintenance work, as always. Keeping alive a
tool like Tails consists mostly of maintenance work that is not very exciting:
publishing new releases every 6 weeks, updating to Tails and our infrastructure
to new versions of Debian or other software that we use, fixing small issues as
they are reported to us, and making small improvements to make Tails easier to
use.

- In October, we released [[Tails 4.0|version_4.0]], which is the first version
  of Tails based on Debian 10 (Buster).

  XXX: Summarize major improvements.

- We published 13 new versions of Tails to continue offering improvements and
  security fixes as soon as possible.

- This year, we published more emergency releases than ever before.  We
  published 5 emergency releases to fix 5 critical security vulnerabilities in
  Firefox and Tor Browser and always keep Tails as secure as possible.

- We removed less popular software and localization packages, which you
  can now install yourself using the [[Additional
  Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]] feature. Optimization
  like these made the ISO image for 4.0 XXX MB smaller than 3.6, which
  was the bigger Tails release ever.

- Tails is depends on a wider ecosystem of Free Software and privacy
  tools. We contributed improvements to other projects which are either
  included in Tails or used on our infrastructure, what we call
  "upstream", among others:

  - [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1062740/accepted-apparmor-2133-5-source-into-unstable/)
  - [GNOME](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/merge_requests/263)
  - [ikiwiki](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=911356)
  - [KeePassXC](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/2593)
  - [OnionShare](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1036041/accepted-onionshare-20-1-source-all-into-unstable/)
  - [Thunderbird](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=971347)
  - [torsocks](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1037418/accepted-torsocks-230-2-source-amd64-into-unstable/)

  XXX: Complete or find better links :intrigeri:

- After 9 years relying on the hosting provider by the fine people of
  boum.org, we migrated all our services to different servers. Our
  website is self-hosted on one of our servers and our mailing lists are
  hosted by 2 other autonomous server projects:
  [autistici.org](https://autistici.org) and
  [puscii.nl](https://puscii.nl).

- We had to temper several [[!wikipedia Denial-of-service_attack
  desc="distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)"]] attacks targeting our
  infrastructure.


Community
=========

- We published a statement of our [[mission and
  values|contribute/mission]] to help us clarify who we are, what we
  stand for, and what we want to do for our users.

- We agreed on [[user personas|contribute/personas]], fictitious but
  concrete representations of the people using Tails. We use these
  personas to keep in mind who we are working for, what are their needs,
  and what Tails should do for them.

- We attended 8 conferences and connected to Free Software and Internet
  freedom communities in 8 different countries, including FOSDEM
  (Belgium), Internet Freedom Festival (Spain), Tor Meeting (Sweden),
  OTF Summit (Taiwan), and DebConf (Brazil).

  XXX: Add last ones (MozFest?)

- The wider Tails community organized 10 workshops to present Tails to
  new users in North and South America, Europe, and East and South-East
  Asia.

- We answered XXX bug reports through our help desk and helped all these
  people to be safer online.

- 2 new workers joined our help desk and sysadmin teams.

All of this is made possible by donations from people like you. And because
these help us to plan our work, we particularly appreciate monthly and yearly donations,
even the smallest ones.
