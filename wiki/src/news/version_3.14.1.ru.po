"A [critical vulnerability](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/"
"mfsa2019-18/)  was discovered in the JavaScript engine of *Firefox* and *Tor "
"Browser*.  This vulnerability allowed a malicious website to execute "
"arbitrary code, which means possibly taking over your browser and turning it "
"into a malicious application."

"vulnerability in Tails is less than in other operating systems.  For "

"in the *Tor Browser* and *Persistent/Tor Browser* folders but not elsewhere "
"in your persistent storage."

"A second security vulnerability (a *sandbox escape*) has been revealed on "
"*Firefox* and *Tor Browser*. This second vulnerability could only be used by "
"other possible vulnerabilities in *Firefox* or *Tor Browser* as a way to do "
"more damage to the operating system. Because in Tails, *Tor Browser* is "
"already confined by *AppArmor*, we think that this second vulnerability is "
"not severe in Tails. That is why, we are releasing 3.14.1 today, without "
"waiting for a fix for this second vulnerability."
