# Changes

## New features

- You can now lock your screen by clicking on the
  <span class="button">[[!img lib/network-wireless-encrypted.png alt="" class="symbolic" link="no"]]</span>
  button in the system menu.

  [[!img doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop/system.png link=no alt="System menu"]]

  - If you set up an [[administration password|first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]]
    when starting Tails, you can unlock your screen with your administration
    password.

  - Otherwise, you can set up a password to unlock your screen when locking your
    screen for the first time.

- We improved a lot the backend of the [[**Additional Software**
  persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]].
  Your additional software is now:

  - Installed in the background after the session starts instead of
    [[blocking the opening of the desktop]].
  - Always installed even if you are offline.

- Install
  [pdf-redact-tools](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/pdf-redact-tools/blob/master/README.md),
  a command line tool to clean metadata and redact PDF files by
  converting them to PNG images.

- XXX: Improve UX when GDM does not start.

## Upgrades and changes

- The **Tails documentation** launcher on the desktop now opens the
  documentation on our website if you are online.

- Install drivers for the [[!wikipedia Video_Acceleration_API]] to
  improve the display of videos on many graphics cards.

- Upgrade *Electrum* from 2.7.9 to [3.0.6](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/3.0.x/RELEASE-NOTES).

- Upgrade *Linux* to 4.15.0.

- Upgrade *Tor* to 0.3.2.10.

- Upgrade *Thunderbird* [52.6.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/52.6.0/releasenotes/).

  We also activated the *AppArmor* profile of *Thunderbird* from Debian
  to [[confine *Thunderbird* for security|contribute/design/application_isolation]].

- Rewrite some internal scripts from shell scripting to Python, thanks
  to [GoodCrypto](https://goodcrypto-private-server.sourceforge.io/).

## Fixed problems

- Remove the display of debug and error messages when starting.

  languages other than English. ([[!tails_ticket 15233]])

# Known issues

- Enigmail is not able to download OpenPGP keys for contacts that don't have
  one in the keyring yet when persistence is enabled. To workaround that, it's
  possible to download the OpenPGP keys through Seahorse before sending the
  email.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].

# Get Tails 3.6

- To install, follow our [[installation instructions|install]].

- To upgrade, automatic upgrades are available from 3.4 and 3.5 to 3.6.

  If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if you fail to start after an
