At Tails, our mission is to empower people worldwide by giving out an operating
system that protects from surveillance and censorship.

We build liberating technology to put people in control of their digital lives
because the most vulnerable and oppressed people are the most in need of
privacy and security:

- Journalists and whistleblowers use Tails to denounce the wrongdoings
  of governments and corporations.
- Activists use Tails to avoid surveillance or organize their
  struggles for liberatory social change.
- Human-rights defenders use Tails to avoid censorship and report
  human-rights violations.
- Domestic violence survivors use Tails to escape surveillance in
  their homes.
- Privacy-concerned citizens use Tails to avoid online tracking.

And we give out Tails for free because nobody should have to pay to be safe
while using computers.

But we know that many of the people who need Tails the most cannot donate,
because they would get in trouble for giving to an anti-surveillance tool like
Tails, or simply because they don't have the money.


Why Tails is more important than ever
=====================================

The [2019 World Press Freedom
Index](https://rsf.org/en/2019-world-press-freedom-index-cycle-fear) compiled
by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) shows how hatred of journalists has
degenerated into violence, contributing to an increase in fear. The number of
countries regarded as safe, where journalists can work in complete security,
continues to decline, while authoritarian regimes continue to tighten their
grip on the media.

According to the [2019 Report of United Nations' Special Rapporteur David
Kaye](http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/HRC/41/35&Lang=E),
surveillance of individuals – often journalists, activists, opposition figures,
critics and others exercising their right to freedom of expression – thrives
because of weak controls on exports and transfers of surveillance technology to
repressive governments. This surveillance is known to lead to arbitrary
detention, sometimes to torture and possibly to extrajudicial killings.

These technologies include targeted malware, online interception of network
communications, and deep packet inspection; all technologies that Tails is one
of the best tool to protect from.

A legal framework to regulate this surveillance industry, as recommended by
David Kaye, might be useful for the future. But digital freedom tools like
Tails are more needed than ever right now, in an act of empowerment and
self-defense.

You are our best guarantee
==========================

We often hear complaints about software projects that are meant to fight
surveillance, like Tor and Tails, getting funds from the US government. We
share this concern and we will never be at ease as long as the well-being of
our project depends on such funding.

This is why it's so important to be sustained by users like you: our
independence depends on you.

Last year, donations from passionate people like you were our first source of
funding. We are extremely proud of this. Let's keep it like this!

In 2017&ndash;2019, our money came from:
