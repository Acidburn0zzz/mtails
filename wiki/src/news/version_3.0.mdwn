[[!tag announce]]

We are especially proud to present you Tails 3.0, the first version of Tails
based on Debian 9 (Stretch). It brings a completely new startup and shutdown
experience, a lot of polishing to the desktop, security improvements in depth,
and major upgrades to a lot of the included software.

Debian 9 (Stretch) will be [released on June
17](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/05/msg00002.html).
It is the first time that we are releasing a new version of Tails almost
at the same time as its new version of Debian. This was an important
objective for us as it is beneficial to both our users and users of
Debian in general and strengthen our [[relationship with
upstream|contribute/relationship_with_upstream]]:

- Our users can benefit from the cool changes in Debian earlier.
- We can detect and fix issues in the new version of Debian while it is
  still in development so that our work also benefits Debian earlier.

This release also fixes [[many security
issues|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_2.12]] and users should
upgrade as soon as possible.

# Changes

## New features

### New startup and shutdown experience

- *Tails Greeter*, the application to configure Tails at startup, has
  been completely redesigned for ease of use:
  - All options are available from a single window.
  - Language and region settings are displayed first to benefit our
    international audience.
  - Accessibility features can be enabled from the start.

  This has been a long process, started three years ago with the UX team of
  [NUMA Paris](https://paris.numa.co/) and lead only by volunteers. Join us on
  [[tails-ux@boum.org|about/contact#tails-ux]] to participate in future
  designs!

- The shutdown experience has also been redesigned in order to be:
  - More reliable. It was crashing on various computers with
    unpredictable results.
  - More discrete. The screen is now totally black to look less
    suspicious.

  Technically speaking, it is now using the [[freed memory poisoning
  feature|contribute/design/memory_erasure]] of the Linux kernel.

### Polishing the desktop

- We switched to the default black theme of GNOME which has a more
  modern and discrete look:

  [[!img black-theme.png link="no"]]

- Tails 3.0 benefits from many other small improvements to the GNOME desktop:

  - *Files* has been redesigned to reduce clutter and make the interface easier
    to use. Several new features have been added, such as the ability to
    rename multiple files at the same time and the ability to extract
    compressed files without needing a separate application.

    [[!img batch-rename.png link="no"]]

  - The notification area has been improved to allow easy access to previous
    notifications. Notification popups have also been repositioned to make them
    more noticeable.

    [[!img message-list.png link="no"]]

  - Shortcut windows have been added to help you discover keyboard shortcuts in
    GNOME applications. For example, press <span class="keycap">Ctrl+F1</span>
    in *Files* to display its shortcut window.

### Security improvements in depth

- Tails 3.0 works on
  <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia x86-64 desc="64-bit computers"]]</span>
  only and not on 32-bit computers anymore. Dropping hardware support,
  even for a small portion of our user base, is always a hard decision
  to make but being 64-bit only has important security and stability
  benefits. For example, to protect against some types of security
  exploits, support for the <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia NX_bit]]</span>
  is compulsory and most binaries are harden with
  <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia Position-independent_code desc="PIE"]]</span>
  which allows <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia Address_space_layout_randomization desc="ASLR"]]</span>.

  [[!toggle id="check" text="Check if your computer is 64-bit or 32-bit."]]

[[!toggleable id="check" text="""
1. Start any Tails version.

1. To open a terminal choose
   <span class="menuchoice"><span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">Utilities</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Terminal</span></span>.

1. Execute the following command to display system information:

           uname -m

   - If the output is `x86_64`, your computer is 64-bit and Tails 3.0
     should work.

   - If the output is `i686`, your computer is 32-bit and Tails 3.0 will
     not work.

- Update *Tor Browser* to 7.0 (based on Firefox 52 ESR) which is
  [multiprocess](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox)
  and enables [content
  sandboxing](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox). This should
  make it harder to exploit security vulnerabilities in the browser.

### Major upgrades to included software

- Most included software has been upgraded in Debian 9, for example:
  - *KeePassX* from 0.4.3 to 2.0.3<br/>
    Your password database will be
    [[migrated automatically|doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords#migrate]]
    to the new database format of *KeePassX* 2 when starting *KeePassX*
    in Tails 3.0.
  - *LibreOffice* 4.3.3 to 5.2.6
  - *Inkscape* from 0.48.5 to 0.92.1
  - *Audacity* from 2.0.6 to 2.1.2
  - *Enigmail* from 1.8.2 to 1.9.6
  - *MAT* 0.5.2 to 0.6.1
  - *Dasher* from 4.11 to 5.0
  - *git* from 2.1.4 to 2.11.0

## Upgrades and changes

- The *Pidgin* tray icon was removed from the top navigation bar and
  replaced by popup notifications. To activate the tray icon again,
  choose
  <span class="menuchoice">
    <span class="guimenu">Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
    <span class="guisubmenu">Preferences</span>&nbsp;▸
    <span class="guimenuitem">Interface</span>
    <span class="guimenuitem">System Tray Icon</span>
  </span> in *Pidgin* and select <span class="guilabel">Always</span> or
  <span class="guilabel">On unread messages</span>.

  [[!img pidgin.png link="no"]]

- *Icedove* was renamed as *Thunderbird*, its original name, inheriting
  this change from Debian.

- The read-only option of the persistent storage was removed. It was
  used by very few users, created confusion, and lead to unexpected
  issues. ([[!tails_ticket 12093]])

## Fixed problems

- The new *X.Org* display server in Tails 3.0 should work on more newer
  graphical hardware.

- UEFI boot has been fixed on some machines (ThinkPad X220).
