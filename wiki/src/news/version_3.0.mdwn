[[!tag announce]]

We are especially proud to present you Tails 3.0, the first version of Tails
based on Debian 9 (Stretch). It brings a completely new startup and shutdown
experience, a lot of polishing to the desktop, security improvements in depth,
and major upgrades to a lot of the included software.

XXX: I'm not 100% convinced by the part "security improvements in depth"... Opinions welcome!

Debian 9 (Stretch) will be [released on June
17](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/05/msg00002.html).
It is the first time that we are releasing a new version of Tails almost
at the same time as its new version of Debian. This was an important
objective for us as it is beneficial to both our users and users of
Debian in general and strengthen our [[relationship with
upstream|contribute/relationship_with_upstream]]:

- Our users can benefit from the cool changes in Debian earlier.
- We can detect and fix issues in the new version of Debian while it is
  still in development so that our work also benefits Debian earlier.

This release also fixes [[many security
issues|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_2.12]] and users should
upgrade as soon as possible.

# Changes

## New features

### New startup and shutdown experience

- *Tails Greeter*, the application to configure Tails at startup, has
  been completely redesigned for ease of use:
  - All options are available from a single window.
  - Language and region settings are displayed first to benefit our
    international audience.
  - Accessibility features can be enabled from the start.

  This has been a long process, started three years ago with the UX team of
  [NUMA Paris](https://paris.numa.co/) and lead only by volunteers. Join us on
  [[tails-ux@boum.org|about/contact#tails-ux]] to participate in future
  designs!

- XXX: Memory wipe: #5417 :spriver:
  - more robust
  - invisible
  - better experience
  - technicalities: https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure

### Polishing the desktop

- We switched to the default black theme of GNOME which has a more
  modern and discrete look:

  [[!img black-theme.png link="no"]]

- Tails 3.0 benefits from many other small improvements to the GNOME desktop:

  - *Files* has been redesigned to reduce clutter and make the interface easier
    to use. Also, several new features have been added, such as the ability to
    rename multiple files at the same time, and the ability to extract
    compressed files without needing a separate application.
  - The Message Tray has been replaced by a new message list, allowing easy
    access to previous notifications. Notification popups have also been
    repositioned to make them more noticeable.
  - Shortcut windows have been added to help you discover keyboard shortcuts in
    GNOME applications.

### Security improvements in depth

- XXX: 64-bits only ISO images :spriver:
  - [[news/Tails_3.0_will_require_a_64-bit_processor]]

- XXX: most binaries are hardened with PIE

- Update *Tor Browser* to 7.0 (based on Firefox 52 ESR) which is
  [multiprocess](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox)
  and enables [content
  sandboxing](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox). This should
  make it harder to exploit security vulnerabilities in the browser.

- XXX: Reproducible build
  - ask anonym and intrigeri whether 3.0 will be reproducible, from
    https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/monthly_report/report_2017_05/ I
    understand that it's not the case yet
  - see #11997#note-6

- XXX: Major versions of included software: :cbrownstein:

    worth mentioning

  - people were asking for KeePassX 2 a lot
  - cross-platform inter-operability?

## Upgrades and changes

- The *Pidgin* tray icon was removed from the top navigation bar and
  replaced by popup notifications. To activate the tray icon again,
  choose
  <span class="menuchoice">
    <span class="guimenu">Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
    <span class="guisubmenu">Preferences</span>&nbsp;▸
    <span class="guimenuitem">Interface</span>
    <span class="guimenuitem">System Tray Icon</span>
  </span> in *Pidgin* and select <span class="guilabel">Always</span> or
  <span class="guilabel">On unread messages</span>.

  [[!img pidgin.png link="no"]]

- *Icedove* was renamed as *Thunderbird*, its original name, inheriting
  this change from Debian.

- The read-only option of the persistent storage was removed. It was
  used by very few users, created confusion, and lead to unexpected
  issues. ([[!tails_ticket 12093]])

## Fixed problems

- The new *X.Org* display server in Tails 3.0 should work on more newer
  graphical hardware.

- UEFI boot has been fixed on some machines (ThinkPad X220).
