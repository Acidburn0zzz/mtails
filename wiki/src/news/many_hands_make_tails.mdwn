Today we are starting a donation campaign to fund our work in 2018.

Tails protects thousands of people everyday to be safe online and we
give out Tails for free because we believe that nobody should have to
pay to be protected from surveillance and censorship.

We've all become used to get content and tools for *free* on the
Internet. However, most of the time, it's because users have become the
new product. While sharing images and messages online, users generate
page and advertisement views - which in turn generate income, reaching
up to several billions of Dollars for some companies.

At Tails we will never sell your data, nor send you targeted
advertising. And we will never sell our project to a company. We have
made this clear in our [[Social
contract|contribute/working_together/social_contract]], which is our
public promise to our users as well as to the rest of the world,
affirming a commitment to our beliefs.

Still, being free software is a necessary requirement for our tools to
be safe and to protect you as intended. If our source code was closed,
there would be no way of actually verifying that our software is
trustworthy.

Last year we've made it clear [[how much of our overall budget came from
government grants|news/why_we_need_donations]] and that, in order to
remain independent and to use our money in the best interest of our
users, we needed to be able to rely on donations. Our first donation
campaign was already a small success in that regard: your donations
covered around one third of our budget of 2017!

While this is amazing, 2018 will arrive fast and our user base is
continously growing. In September 2017 we counted 21.754 boots per day
on average. ([[How do we know this?|support/faq#boot_statistics]])
**Many hands make Tails: If each of our users gave $15, our budget for
the whole year would be raised within one day.** If we could fund Tails
entirely through donations by our users, this would make us independent
from government grants, as our budget remains very small compared to the
multibillionaire companies and agencies running the surveillance
business.

But many of our users could actually get in trouble if they donated to
an anti-surveillance tool like Tails. So when donating to Tails you are
also [[giving a hand to these people|news/who_are_you_helping]] by
keeping Tails alive. Please consider setting up a yearly or monthly
donation.

If you want Tails to remain independent, please take five minutes and give us a hand:
