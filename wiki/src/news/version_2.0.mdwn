[[!tag announce]]

We are especially proud to present you Tails 2.0!

Tails 2.0 is the first version of Tails based on:

  - GNOME Shell, which changes a lot the desktop.
  - Debian 8 (Jessie), which upgrades most included software and changes
    many things under the hood.

This release also fixes [[numerous security
issues|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_1.8.2]] and all users must
upgrade as soon as possible.
