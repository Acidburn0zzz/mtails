Through our end-of-year donation campaign we managed to raise
~103&thinsp;000€, which is nearly half of our yearly budget for core work and
maintenance. A big thanks to everybody who donated!

To fill the gap, we are extremely happy to be part of [DuckDuckGo's
privacy crowdrising
challenge](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-privacy-challenge-2018/).

If you haven't donated to Tails recently, now is a great opportunity to
support us as your donation is likely to be matched by DuckDuckGo. It
will also help us get one of the grand prizes awarded by DuckDuckGo, up
to $50&thinsp;000.
