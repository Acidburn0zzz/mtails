<em>Free, libre, and open source software projects quietly save the
world every day, even when you can't see it, and their success depends
on your support.</em> <small>([Edward

Through our end-of-year donation campaign we managed to raise
~103&thinsp;000€, which is nearly half of our yearly budget for core work and
maintenance. A big thanks to everybody who donated!

To fill the gap, we are extremely happy to be part of [DuckDuckGo's
privacy crowdrising
challenge](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-privacy-challenge-2018/).

Your donation is likely to be multiplied as it will be matched by
DuckDuckGo and if we manage to raise enough by the end of the challenge
on April 10th 2018, we might even receive a bonus up to $50&thinsp;000.

[Donate to Tails via the DuckDuckGo donation challenge](https://www.crowdrise.com/tails-live)

Tails is an entire operating system which preserves your privacy and
provides anonymity out-of-the-box. With Tails, you can use the Internet
anonymously and circumvent censorship. You'll be in control about the
traces you want to leave and those that you'd rather see forgotten.
Installed onto a USB key, Tails discreetly fits into your pocket.

For the past 9 years, we've been working on making digital security
accessible to those who need it most. Counting more than 20&thinsp;000 boots
per day, we've proved that Tails is a reliable and successful tool that
helps diverse people around the world to be safe online every day. But
we think that the immense work we've done until now should have an even
bigger impact on the world!

Even if you're not a Tails user yourself, your donation will [[help human
rights defenders, journalists, activists, victims of domestic violence
and many others|who_are_you_helping/]] who rely on Tails every day.

Another detail that makes our work awesome is that we contribute our
improvements back to the free software community. When donating to
Tails, you're supporting an entire ecosystem which we are part of.
