# Changes

[[!inline pages="inc/release_notes/1.8" raw="yes"]]

# Known issues

* Automatic upgrades are much slower to apply than before.
  Expect the upgrade to take around an hour *after* the download is
  finished. See [[!tails_ticket 10757]] for details.

* The [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]] fails if the
  system clock is incorrect. To prevent this problem, correct the system
  clock *before* connecting to the network. To do so:

  1. [[Set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]]
     when starting Tails.

  1. Right-click on the system clock in the top navigation bar and
     choose <span class="guimenuitem">Adjust Date & Time</span>.

  1. Click the <span class="button">Unlock</span> button and enter the
     administration password from step 1.

  1. Adjust the time to be the correct time in
     [[!wikipedia Coordinated_Universal_Time desc="UTC"]] (use the
     same difference with your local time as observed usually in Tails).

See the current list of [[known issues|support/known_issues]].

# Download or upgrade

Go to the [[install]] or [[upgrade|doc/first_steps/upgrade/]] page.

If your Tails does not
boot after an automatic upgrade, please [[upgrade your Tails
manually|doc/first_steps/upgrade#manual]].
