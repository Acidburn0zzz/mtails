# Changes

[[!inline pages="inc/release_notes/1.8" raw="yes"]]

# Known issues

* Incremental upgrades are much slower to apply than before.
  Expect the upgrade to take around an hour *after* the download is
  finished. See [[!tails_ticket 10757]] for details.

* The [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]] fails if the
  system clock is incorrect. To prevent this problem, correct the system
  clock *before* connecting to the network. This requires setting an
  [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/]].

See the current list of [[known issues|support/known_issues]].

# Download or upgrade

Go to the [[download]] or [[upgrade|doc/first_steps/upgrade/]] page.

If your Tails does not
boot after an automatic upgrade, please [[upgrade your Tails
manually|doc/first_steps/upgrade#manual]].
