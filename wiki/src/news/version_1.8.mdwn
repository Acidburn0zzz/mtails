# Changes

[[!inline pages="inc/release_notes/1.8" raw="yes"]]

# Known issues

* Incremental upgrades are much slower to apply than before. You can
  expect it to take around an hour *after* the upgrade has been
  downloaded. See [[!tails_bug 10757]] for details.

* If your system clock is incorrect, then
  [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]] will not work. One
  way to work around this is to correct the system before connecting
  to the network, which will require setting an
  [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/]].

See the current list of [[known issues|support/known_issues]].

# Download or upgrade

Go to the [[download]] or [[upgrade|doc/first_steps/upgrade/]] page.

If your Tails does not
boot after an automatic upgrade, please [[upgrade your Tails
manually|doc/first_steps/upgrade#manual]].
