[[!meta title="Development chat"]]

In addition to the [[#tails general chatroom|support/chat]],
we have a dedicated chatroom for development.

To join it, use your preferred instant messaging client that supports XMPP, e.g.
[[Pidgin|http://www.pidgin.im/]], which runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and
Mac OSÂ X.

Here are the needed technical details:

* protocol: XMPP
* server: `conference.conference.riseup.net`
* channel: `tails-dev`
* Use TLS/SSL to connect!
