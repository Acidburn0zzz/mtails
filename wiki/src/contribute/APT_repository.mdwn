We have three kinds of APT repositories:

* our [[custom APT repository|contribute/APT_repository/custom]],
  that stores our custom Debian packages;
* (full) [[contribute/APT_repository/time-based snapshots]] of the
  upstream APT repositories we use, so that we can use frozen
  versions thereof when needed;
* (partial) [[contribute/APT_repository/tagged snapshots]] of upstream
  APT repositories we need, so that one can rebuild a released ISO in
  the future, and keep the corresponding source code around.
