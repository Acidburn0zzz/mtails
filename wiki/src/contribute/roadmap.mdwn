Priorities for the next years
=============================

Here is a summary of our priorities for the next years:

  - **Easier adoption**
    - **Rethink the installation and upgrade process**: take a step back and reflect
      on the future of Tails Installer, the installation on Windows and
      Mac, and automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 11679]])
    - **Graphical installation method for macOS**: what would it take
      to document tools other than Tails Installer to do a graphical
      installation from macOS? ([[!tails_ticket 11682]])
    - **Explain better what Tails is** and what makes it so awesome ([[!tails_ticket 9814]])

  - **Security hardening**
    - **Persistent Tor state**: have persistent entry guards ([[!tails_ticket 5462]])
    - **HTTPS mirrors**: serve our downloads over HTTPS only ([[!tails_ticket 9796]])
    - **Persistent seed for random number generator**: have better entropy and stronger crypto ([[!tails_ticket 7675]])

  - **Community**
    - **Personas**: study and describe our user base to take better
      design decisions ([[!tails_ticket 11162]])

  - **Better user support**
    - **Request tracker**: platform to handle better support requests (XXX)

  - **Sustainability**
    - **Better server infrastructure**: to handle our growing needs on continuous integration and have a backup server ([[!tails_ticket 11680]])

  - **Fundraising**
    - **Have more reliable and steady sources of incomes**
    - **Depend less on grants from governments**

  - **New applications and features**
    - **Graphical interface for the Additional Packages persistent feature**: allow users to customize which applications are available in their Tails ([[!tails_ticket 5996]] [[!tails_ticket 9059]])
    - **Backups**: provide a graphical tool to backup the persistent volume ([[!tails_ticket 5301]])
    - **Screen locker**: allow users to lock their session with a password ([[!tails_ticket 5684]])
    - **Tails Server**: run onion services from Tails (VoIP chat rooms, collaboration tools, web servers, messaging servers, etc.) ([[!tails_ticket 5688]])
    - **TrueCrypt support in GNOME**: graphical utilities to mount TrueCrypt volumes ([[!tails_ticket 11684]], [[!tails_ticket 6337]])
