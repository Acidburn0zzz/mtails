Priorities for the next years
=============================

Here is a summary of our priorities for the next years:

  - **Easier adoption**
    - **Rethink the installation and upgrade process** in depth and reflect
      on the future of *Tails Installer*, the installation on Windows and
      macOS, and automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 11679]])
    - **Redesign the Download and Verify browser extension** to support *Chrome*
      and *Web Extensions* in *Firefox* 57 ([[!tails_ticket 12328]])
    - **Improve our installation instructions**:
      - Find a graphical installation tool for macOS ([[!tails_ticket 11682]])
      - Have a more robust tool for Windows ([[!tails_ticket 13206]])
      - Act on the expert review done in August 2017 ([[!tails_ticket 12328]])
    - **Give some love to our troubleshooting documentation**:
      - Our [[known issues page|support/known_issues]] ([[!tails_ticket 11665]])

    - **Create outreach material** ([[!tails_ticket 14523]])
    - **Outreach to under-represented communities** ([[!tails_ticket 14560]])
    - **Recruit new core workers**: sysadmin, technical writer, and accountant
    - **Lower technical requirements** for new contributors ([[!tails_ticket 14516]])

  - **Be more user-centric**
    - **Perform surveys** to learn who our users are and what they need ([[!tails_ticket 14545]])
    - **Agree on personas** describing our primary target users to take better decisions ([[!tails_ticket 11162]])
    - **Power our help desk with a request tracker** to know better how to help our user base at large ([[!tails_ticket 9803]])

  - **Have more unrestricted funding from private partners**
    - **Strenghten our relationships** with existing partners
    - **Contact proactively** more potential partners
    - **Document better benefits** for partners

  - **Sustainability of our core code**
    - **Try basing Tails on rolling snapshots of Debian Testing** to bring
      upstream changes earlier to Tails and collaborate better with upstream
      ([[!tails_ticket 12615]])
    - **Have a budget for user-visible improvements** to our core applications
    - **Port complex shell scripts to Python** ([[!tails_ticket 11189]])
