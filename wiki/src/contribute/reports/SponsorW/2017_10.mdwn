Everything in this report is public.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.1 Research user needs and development costs

- **User needs**:

  - We installed [*LimeSurvey* on our infrastructure](https://survey.tails.boum.org).

  - We created a draft survey and refined it after conducting two pilot
    tests with *VeraCrypt* users.

  - We advertised the final survey from the homepage of *Tor Browser* in
    Tails on October 17:

  - Our users have been [very responsive to our
    call](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-October/003505.html)
    and since then we have gathered 30 complete answers to the survey each
    day on average, reaching 375 in total on October 30.

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks

  - Since VeraCrypt volumes are, by design, not distinguishable from random data, we researched ways to indicate to the user that a volume might be a VeraCrypt volume.
  - We implemented a method to assess whether a volume is a candidate for being VeraCrypt encrypted.
  - We researched and started discussing different ways to handle unlocking of VeraCrypt candidates.

## A.5 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Disks

We added preliminary support for locking and unlocking VeraCrypt volumes in GNOME Disks.

# B. Additional software

We started working on one of the major UX improvements this project is
about ([[!tails_ticket 9059]]) and on minor UX improvement that is not
formally part of this project, but would be nice to have ([[!tails_ticket 6038]]).

# C. Deliver new features

We're not there yet.
