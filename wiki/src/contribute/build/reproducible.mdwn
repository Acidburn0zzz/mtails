What are reproducible builds?
=============================

Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that
create a verifiable path from human readable source code to the binary
code used by computers.

Most aspects of software verification are done on source code, as that
is what humans can reasonably understand. But most of the time,
computers require software to be first built into a long string of
numbers to be used. With reproducible builds, multiple parties can redo
this process independently and ensure they all get exactly the same
result. We can thus gain confidence that a distributed binary code is
indeed coming from a given source code. (Quoted from
[[https://reproducible-builds.org]])

Tails ISO images should be reproducible: everybody who
builds the ISO should be able to obtain the exact same resulting ISO
image from a given Git commit.

How is it done?
===============

First, the build system needs to be made entirely deterministic:
transforming a given source must always create the same result.
Typically, the current date and time must not be recorded and output
always has to be written in the same order.

Second, the set of tools used to perform the build and more generally
the build environment is pre-defined.

Third, users are given a way to recreate a close enough build
environment, perform the build process, and verify that the output
matches the original build.

How do I verify my build against an official build?
===================================================

Using OpenPGP
-------------

When you reproducibly build our ISO you should obtain a file that is
exactly the same as the official Tails ISO image, thus, *our* signature
should be able to verify *your* ISO for you.
[[Download our OpenPGP signature|/install/download/openpgp]] and verify
it against your own build.

Using checksums
---------------

Furthermore, you can find the SHA-256 sum of the latest ISO in our
[IDFs](https://tails.boum.org/install/v1/Tails/amd64/stable/latest.yml).
This SHA sum can also be used to verify that you obtained the same ISO
image by running `sha256sum yourimage.iso` on your ISO and comparing
both sums to each other.

Verifying IUKs

Why is it important?
====================

Reproducibility increases confidence in the value of our continuous
quality assurance processes as well as the trust that users, and anyone
interested can put into our released build products (such as ISO images)
and our development and release process.

Reproducible builds help [detect
bugs](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/) and ensure that
there is no bit flip that makes us waste precious hours during a release
process.

Most important, a reproducible build allows for independent verification
that a build product matches what the source intended to produce. This
helps to better resist [attacks against build machines and
developers](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/), improves
users' security, and allows developers to sleep better at night (as the
incentive for an attacker to compromise developers' systems, or to
compromise developers themselves, is lowered). In turn, this avoids the
need to trust people (or software) who build the ISO we release, which
in turn allows more people to get involved in release management work.

Release managers do not have to upload the ISO image anymore when they
do a release: they could instead build it both on our infrastructure
(Jenkins) and locally and compare the outputs: if they match, one can
publish the ISO built by Jenkins. Uploading an ISO can take many hours
with some commonly found means of accessing the Internet, so removing
the need to go through this step decreases our time to remediation for
fixing security issues, and makes it easier for developers with poor
access to the Internet to take care of a release.
