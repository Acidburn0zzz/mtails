# Create and update issues

When a developer works on a task, she should create/update a GitLab issue related to
the task. All the knowledge useful to the others should be kept there (or at
least linked from there). She should take care of updating this issue's
[[metadata|/contribute/working_together/GitLab#metadata]] so that they reflect
the actual status of the task, and especially the next thing to do for it to be
solved.

The issues are stored in [[!tails_gitlab "" desc="GitLab"]].

When committing changes that will resolve an issue once merged, please
include `#NNNN` in the commit message, _NNNN_
being the issue number. Then, GitLab will automatically reference this
commit on the corresponding issue, once the branch is pushed to our
main [[Git repository|contribute/Git]]. For example:

    Remove tails@boum.org duty from frontdesk (#8420)

# Report progress or failure

It is important for the team to know whether somebody is feeling responsible to
make a task happen, or that it's a wishlist/patches-welcome/don't-care-that-much
(would be great, but *We* don't feel committed to make it happen any time soon).

Thus, it is great to state if you'd like to do it, but also to state if you
won't do it anymore. Don't feel guilty: it's better if we all know it won't happen
soon rather than you feel pressured while having other priorities!
