# Full test suite vs. scenarios tagged `@fragile`

Jenkins generally only runs scenarios that are _not_ tagged `@fragile`
in Gherkin. But it runs the full test suite, including scenarios that
are tagged `@fragile`, if the images under test were built:

 - from a branch whose name ends with the `+force-all-tests` suffix
 - from a tag
 - from the `devel` branch
 - from the `testing` branch
 - from the `feature/tor-nightly-master` branch

Therefore, to ask Jenkins to run the full test suite on your topic
branch, give it a name that ends `+force-all-tests`.

# Trigger a test suite run without rebuilding images

Every `build_Tails_ISO_*` job run triggers a test suite run
(`test_Tails_ISO_*`), so most of the time, we don't need
to manually trigger test suite runs.

However, in some cases, all we want is to run the test suite multiple
times on a given set of Tails images, that were already built. In such
cases, it is useless and problematic to trigger a build job, merely to
get the test suite running eventually:

 - It's a waste of resources: it will keep isobuilders uselessly busy,
   which makes the feedback loop longer for our other team-mates.
 - It forces us to wait at least one extra hour before we get the
   test suite feedback we want.

Thankfully, there is a way to trigger a test suite run without
having to rebuild images first. To do so, start a "build" of the
corresponding `wrap_test_Tail_ISO_*` job.

<div class="caution">
Do <strong>not</strong> directly start a <code>test_Tail_ISO_*</code> job:
this is not supported. It would fail most of the time in confusing ways.
</div>

# Old ISO used in the test suite in Jenkins

Some tests like upgrading Tails are done against a Tails installation made from
the previously released ISO.

In some cases (e.g when the _Tails Installer_ interface has changed), we need to
temporarily change this behaviour to make tests work. To have Jenkins
use the ISO being tested instead of the last released one:

1. Set `USE_LAST_RELEASE_AS_OLD_ISO=no` in the
   `macros/test_Tails_ISO.yaml` and
   `macros/manual_test_Tails_ISO.yaml` files in the
   `jenkins-jobs` Git repository
   (`gitolite@git.puppet.tails.boum.org:jenkins-jobs`).

   Documentation and policy to access this repository is the same as
   for our [[Puppet modules|contribute/git#puppet]].

   See for example
   [commit 371be73](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/jenkins-jobs/commit/?id=371be73).

   <div class="note">
   Treat the repository at immerda as a read-only mirror: any change
   pushed there does not affect our infrastructure and will
   be overwritten.
   </div>

   Under the hood, once this change is applied Jenkins will pass the
   ISO being tested (instead of the last released one) to
   `run_test_suite`'s `--old-iso` argument.

2. File a ticket to ensure this temporarily change gets reverted
   in due time.
