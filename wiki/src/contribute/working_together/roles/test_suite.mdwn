[[!meta title="Test suite maintainers"]]

Test suite maintainers are responsible for taking care of our automated
test suite by:

  - Making the test suite more robust and maintainable, build in new
    generic features (snapshots, network services, refactoring, etc.).
  - Write tests for regressions, unexpected or unbudgeted features, etc.

Writing tests for new features should be estimated and budgeted each
time we write grant applications for such features.

Writing tests to replace our old manual tests should also be budgeted
separately.
