[[!meta title="Verification extension maintainers"]]

The maintenance of the [[verification
extension|design/verification_extension]] falls slightly outside of our
current skill set and it's hard to find a person who can take over all
its maintenance. So the work is split among different people according
to their skills and availability:

- The maintainer:
  - Tracks the release of third-party libraries and updates them.
  - Tests the extension on beta versions of Firefox and Chrome.
  - Tests and releases new versions of the extension.
  - Maintains the corresponding HTML and JavaScript on our website.
  - Manages the yearly budget for the maintenance of the extension and
    allocate the work to be done to other contributors.

- Other contributors:
  - Ports the code of the extension to new versions of Firefox, Chrome,
    and the third-party libraries.
  - Our secret JavaScript expert when we have no other option or when we
    require more security expertise.
