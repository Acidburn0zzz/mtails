[[!meta title="Ticket gardener"]]

The aim of ticket gardening is to ensure that items tracked on Redmine stay
relevant and contain helpful information for bringing a task to completion.  To
achieve this goal contributors and teams need to be made aware of the existence
of tickets that need their input so they can self-organize and prioritize their
work. Tickets that are not relevant anymore should be closed.

This work should be done twice per year.

# Tasks

## Manual tasks

### Go through relevant Redmine views

* ["Wait" type of work](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=314):
  check if what was blocking was eventually resolved outside of Tails.
  Tickets should either have an assignee, their type of work
  requalified, be rejected, or stay in this state.

* [WIP without assignee](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=141):
  identify tickets that have a majority of work completed and could
  somewhat easily be finished. Create a list of those tickets and send
  them to the responsible team; if that team cannot handle these tickets,
  set _Status_ to something else.

### Identify and fix inadequate _Target version_

While we still use Redmine, some tickets are missed by our automated
setup. These tickets are those which have a target version that's been
postponed after the N last releases by the Release Manager: every such
_Target version_ bump counts as an update so there's no chance the ticket will
ever be identified as stalled. Hence we need to do a manual session of ~2 hours
twice a year to drop the _Target version_ on some tickets. To select the
corresponding tickets, we will thus select those that have _Target version_
set to the next release, and triage them using the following criteria:

Situations when dropping the _Target version_ would be inadequate:

* If the ticket was (re)assigned to the assignee recently.
* If there's been progress but it's not documented on the ticket.
* If it's part of a sponsor deliverable.
  - If the official deadline is in the future, most of the time we don't want
    to touch the _Target version_.

Whether it's appropriate to drop the _Target version_ depends on:

* When the last action on the ticket by the assignee was performed. For
  example, if they did not update the ticket since 3 months or more.
* If the ticket was recently postponed be the RM and not by the assignee
  themselves â€” the latter would suggest they have it in mind and are updating
  their plans.
* Whether there's an assignee. If there's none but the ticket was postponed a few times, then:
  - Either it's important and it should be put on the plate of a core team.
  - Or it's unimportant and the _Target version_ should be dropped: keeping it
    has little value but forces the RMs to do extra work. If someone wants to track
    those tickets, there surely are better ways.
* Whether the ticket is blocked by anything (other tickets or what not) that's
  out of the hands of the assignee.
* How safe/privileged is the assignee's position in Tails. For contributors
  that hold more power than average we can assume they know how to revert our
  changes.

## Existing automation

* The [WIP stalled for a while](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=316)
  view provides an overview to each individual contributor about work that is in
  progress but seems to be stalled.  An [[!tails_ticket
  16545 desc="automated email reminder"]] sends everyone on that list a link to this Redmine view, filtered for
  them, asking them if they think they can realistically come back to it and
  finish the work in the next 6 months.
  If yes, a suitable target version and when relevant, a blocking relationship to the relevant "Core work:
  $team in $quarter"ticket, should be added to the ticket.  If no, contributor should
  clear the _Assignee_ field and bring it to the attention of the relevant team.

* The [Stalled: unblock other people's
  work](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=317)
  view provides to an individual contributor the list of tickets where
  someone has been waiting for a review or for information from them since
  a while. An [[!tails_ticket 16545 desc="email reminder"]]
  regularly suggests contributors to take a look there.
