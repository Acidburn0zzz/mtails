[[!meta title="Worker for sponsor deliverables"]]

Every worker paid to do work on a deliverable we've promised to
a sponsor is responsible for:

- You are responsible for tracking which ticket corresponds to which
  deliverable, and to ensure every deliverable has a ticket.

  * Set the "Deliverable for" Redmine field for every ticket that's
    about work we promised to the sponsor.

  * Use the "Target version" field in Redmine to track your plans and
    timing goals.

- Check how good you're doing wrt. their deliverables and deadlines.
  => comes for free as "Workers" can see nice Redmine views.

- Schedule work in advance to meet deadlines.
  => same as above

- Report the progress on a deliverable when requested. Summarize the
  tickets and achievements of each deliverables since the last report.
  This information will then be transmitted to accounting for the
  invoicing. Clarify the matching between tickets and deliverables and
  for example, you can report:

   * "B.3.7 done: #nnnn, #mmmm, etc.", and all these tickets
     are supposed to be closed or fix committed.
   * "C.4.2 (#nnnn, #mmmm) in progress but not done because of
     $reasons".

- When reporting, if you want to adjust the way the money for a given
  task is split within your team, then specify it. For example if you
  delegated one of your task to someone else and want to give her your
  money, then specify this. If you want to split your money with
  someone else, then specify this as well. Remember that we are taking
  as a reference for payment the time estimate that we agreed upon
  while preparing the grant and won't pay more. You should have this
  information somewhere, otherwise ask the
  [[Accounting Team|about/contact#tails-accounting]] to send it to
  you again.
