[[!meta title="Team Manager for a sponsored project"]]

Every manager for a team that works on a deliverable we've promised to
a sponsor is responsible for:

- Check status of deliverables wrt. past and future deadlines,
  and report on this to -fundraising@ (for reporting) and -accounting@
  (for invoicing), unless -fundraising@ forwards. Whatever.
  => solved by "Deliverable for" in Redmine:
     all "Workers", and thus TMs, have access to it, while they don't
     necessarily have access to {fundraising,accounting}.git
     This implies that:
      * TMs ensure the "Deliverable for" information
        is up-to-date, e.g. newly created blocking tickets have this
        field added.
      * -accounting@ ensures that the "Deliverable for" information
        has been added in the first place (when the grant proposal
        is accepted).

  Workers and TMs have access to budget-original.mdwn, so *they* are
  supposed to know what tickets correspond to each deliverable.
  Then those who report about work should say as the example in the
  template does:

   * "B.3.7 done: #nnn, #mmmm, etc.", and all these tickets
     are supposed to be closed or fix committed
   * "C.4.2 (#nnn, #mmmm) in progress but not done because of
     $reasons"
