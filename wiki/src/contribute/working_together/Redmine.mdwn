Tails tasks are managed in a [[!tails_redmine "" desc="Redmine project"]].

If you need to do something in Redmine, but you appear to lack the
needed credentials, please ask <tails-sysadmins@boum.org> to give you
more power.

Some documentation about how we are using Redmine is available in the
[[contribute/working_together]] pages. See also the [[review and merge
process|contribute/merge_policy/review]] documentation and [[document
progress|contribute/working_together/document_progress/]].

Atom feeds
==========

Each custom query listed in the Redmine sidebar has an Atom feed.

Tracking review'n'merge requests
--------------------------------

Subscribe to:

* the [*Fix
  committed*](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=111)
  feed;
* the [*Ready for
  QA*](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=117) feed.

How to use Redmine's Atom feeds
-------------------------------

To use a Redmine Atom feed:

1. Log into Redmine.
2. Go to the *My account* page.
3. Define an *Atom access key*.
4. Go to the custom query you want to track.
5. Look for the *Atom* link at the bottom of the page.
6. Point your feed reader to that link.

Email commands
==============

For details, see the [corresponding documentation on the Redmine
website](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineReceivingEmails#How-it-works).

Create a ticket by email
------------------------

You need to provide all the required fields in the body of the email, and the
syntax is case sensitive. For example this works:

    To: redmine@labs.riseup.net
    Subject: Test creating a ticket by email

        Project: tails
        Tracker: Feature
        Status: Confirmed
        Priority: Low
        Type of work: Test

        It should be possible to create a ticket by sending an email to Redmine.

If you send attachments with your email they will also be attached to the
ticket. For example your OpenPGP signature :)

Updating a ticket by email
--------------------------

An easy trick is to reply to an email notification about that ticket. Then only
include in the body of the email the fields that you want to change, and a
description for your changes. For example:

    To: redmine@labs.riseup.net
    Subject: Re: [Tails - Feature #6813] (Confirmed) Test creating a ticket by email

    Status: Resolved

    This works but Redmine is quite picky on the syntax...

How to use Redmine fields
=========================

It is important to be consistent in the use of the fields to make collective work
easier. Please take a time to see how we use the fields of Redmine:

* Subject
* Description:
  - For the preferred style of this field refer to our [[bug reporting
    instructions|/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]]
* Status
 * New:
   - New users' tickets are marked always as new. If a TailsContributor can
     reproduce the issue, it should be marked as *confirmed*.
   - Frontdesk team is in charge of keeping an eye on them.
 * Confirmed:
   - Tails contributors can reproduce the issue.
 * In Progress:
   - Code has been submitted for review, committed to the Tails `experimental`
     repository or work is being done if is not code.
   - Added by Redmine automatically when a git commit with `will-fix: #NNNN`
     is added to the Tails repository. This keyword should be only used in
     topic branches.
 * Fix committed:
   - The fix has been merged to the `tails` repository
   - Added by Redmine automatically when a git commit with `fix-committed: #NNNN`
     is added to the Tails repository.
 * Resolved:
   - Fix is on current Tails
 * Duplicate:
   - Other ticket covers this issue
 * Rejected:
   - Not applicable, not a Tails problem, being worked on elsewhere.
* Priority
 * Low:
   - It would be good to have it, but nobody is volunteering to do it.
 * Normal
 * Elevated:
   - Regressions are always marked as Elevated.
 * High
 * Urgent
* Assignee:
  - Assign yourself to a ticket if you are working on it to prevent duplicated
    work.

    someone.

      important to speed up development.

    organize work that spans many tickets. See for example: [[!tails_ticket 7584]]

* Estimated time
* % Done
* Blueprint:
  - Many times the work to fix the tickets is also done in a wiki page, see
    <https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/>

  - Issues flagged as `Easy` on Redmine are a great tool for new contributors
    getting into Tails. [[Learn
