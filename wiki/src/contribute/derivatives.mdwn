[[!meta title="About creating Tails derivatives"]]

Several projects expressed interest in reusing Tails to build different
live distributions, also called *derivatives*, to fulfill slightly
different goals.

Tails being free software this is not only possible be encouraged,
because the more people look and work on our code, the better it gets.
Still, at this time we don't know of any Tails derivative.

Derivatives have been imagined to:

- Include additional features or software that we are not ready to add to Tails (for example
  to include GNUnet or Namecoin).
- Have custom branding or configuration.
- Provide ISO images with less or different features (for example to
  have a VPN instead of Tor or an ISO image smaller in size).

While creating custom ISO images of Tails is relatively easy, we believe
that maintaining custom ISO images on the long run is very complicated,
and for the following reasons:

- We release a new version every 6 weeks which fixes numerous security
  issues. We also release unscheduled security releases quite often (3-4
  times per year).

  A derivative with custom ISO images would have to follow the same
  release schedule to provide ISO images that fix these issues as well.

- Before we release them, our ISO images follow a complex quality
  assurance process involving systematic peer review of the code,
  [[manual|contribute/release_process/test]] and
  [[automated|contribute/release_process/test/automated_tests]] tests
  which are particularly heavy to run.

  A derivative with custom ISO images would have to duplicate our
  quality assurance process and adapt it to its specificities to make
  sure that it doesn't break any security feature.

- We offer automatic upgrades which are binary diffs from one ISO image
  to the other.

  A derivative with custom ISO images would need a similar process and
  infrastructure or otherwise break the automatic upgrades mechanism.

- We provide authenticated downloads through a custom browser extension
  and an OpenPGP signing key well connected to the web-of-trust.

  It would be hard for a derivative with custom ISO images to provide
  similar mechanisms.

- The anonymity provided by Tor and Tails works by making everybody
  looks the same, especially on the network. Derivatives should be
  careful about not breaking this anonymity set or otherwise provide
  less anonymity to both its users and Tails users.

- In Tails we have very high quality standards, and derivatives could be
  tempted to implement some of the features Tails is missing too quickly
  and hastily.

Still, some of the reasons to create Tails derivatives could be solved
by **relying our official ISO images** and customizing them at run time.
For example, derivatives could:

- Package specific applications in Debian to make them easier to use in
  Tails.
- Document how to use specific applications in Tails.
- Rely on the customizations mechanisms already available in Tails
  (additional software packages and persistent storage).
- Help us build in Tails other mechanisms that derivatives might need to
  adapt Tails to their needs (for example to have persistent DConf
  settings or APT sources).
- Talk with us to see how we can adapt our ISO images and source code to
  make them easier to reuse for derivatives.
- To include a piece of software into Tails, talk to us as early as
  possible so we can provide feedback on how to integrate it.

Some other non-technical questions remain open:

- Will derivatives appear as being "Tails" to their users while having
  different security features than Tails?
- Shall Tails review ourselves the work of derivatives and "endorse"
  them officially?
- How would the work or reputation of derivatives impact the reputation
  of Tails?
