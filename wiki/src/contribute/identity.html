<h2>Our mission</h3>

<p>We empower people by providing a usable and privacy-preserving
alternative OS.</p>

<!--
- (-) "more secure communications" → "more secure world"
- (-) "Alternative OS"?? → "convenience", "disposable", "momentary"
The Fighter: We fight for people’s right to be private—online and offline.
The Hacker: We develop, curate, and package best privacy tools for the community.
The Protector: We protect people against surveillance and censorship.
The Provider: We empower people to use security technology otherwise inaccessible to them.

<h2>Our personality</h2>

<p>Elite vs Mass appeal</p>

<p>Confident vs Cautious</p>
<!--
- (!=) "vigilant" → "cautious"
- (++) "Confident": we want to be more confident in our message
  - Tails is a political statement:
    - Everybody should have privacy online.
    - Computers are tools used by people with power to control
      people with less power, related to "empowering".

<p>Impartial vs Ideological</p>
<!--
- (-) 100% ideological
- (++) More towards impartial than ideological
- (-) Ideological 100% → "privacy preservation is not ideological"

<div id="values" class="col-sm-6">

<h2>Our values</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>No bullshit</h3>
<p>Tails is safe but not magic. We don't promise all-round security
and limitations are communicated timely and accurately.</p>
</li>
<!--
- (++) "No bullshit" → "honest"?
- (!=) "Straight-talking": people had a hard time understand or
  relating to this term. "No bullshit" was clearer
- (!=) "Straight-talking": we have this deep in our DNS and
  sometimes do it too much.
- (++) "without patronizing"
-->
<li>
<h3>Ecosystemic</h3>
<p>Tails works and shared with other projects and creates what's
missing. We model free software values.</p>
<!--
Tails is interoperable with other projects, and actively cooperates with them.
Tails works with other projects to build sustainable tools.
- (++) "to build sustainable tools"
- (!=) Add "sustainable" to "ecosystemic"
  - Tails has to be sustainable to be useful for people
    and not die in a few months
- (!=) "shares" → "give back"
- (-) "We model our free software values" ???
- (!=) "cooperates" → "for what"?, "integrated"
- (!=) "Cooperative": with a good explanation, we prefer
  'ecosystemic'.
  - We are sharing with other projects and create what is missing.
  - Tails is an alternative OS, not something that users run all the
    time, so it's also important for Tais to fit nicely in the rest
    of the users workflows and tools.
  - Sharing with other projects was very strong in our original
    vision but, as it's strongly in our DNS, could maybe be put more
    in the background in the future.
- (-) "My data, my choice": digital security and privacy is not an
  individual matter always involves several parties and is a
  societal matter.
-->
</li>
<li>
<h3>Inclusive</h3>
<p>Tails is committed to building usable tools for a diverse
community. We listen to users and provide help where we can.</p>
<!--
- (!=) "Inclusive" → "Accessible"
- (!=) Put accessibility before security
- (++) "Inclusive".
- (!=) "listen to" → "understand"
- (!=) "Accessible": could we find a way of combining 'accessible'
- (++) "Accessible"
  with 'inclusive', 'usable tools for a diverse community'.
- (++) "Tails is committed to building usable tools": for a diverse
  audience.
- (!=) "inaccessible" → "unusable"
  - Is Tails making tools easier to use?
  - People don't care so much about the underlying technology but
    about what it permits
-->
<!--
<h3>Empowering</h3>
<p>Tails puts people in control of their privacy and security.</p>
- (!=) "Empowering": it's not only a personal matter, empowering
  should be put in a larger perspective, a conflict, empowering
  people who are oppressed.
- (++) "Empowering": the tool is empowering by its usage.
- (!=) "Put people in control": while being careful not to give
  users too many choices as it add complexity and be scary.
- (-) "For freedom": we prefer "empowering".
- (++) "dedicated", "trustworthy", "committed": Important!
  - We are here to help people.

- (++) "Journalists, activists, people who are surveilled and
  censored": matches our audience.

- (!=) "NGOs": NGO can have a bad connotation even though with want
  to work for 'non-governemental' and 'organizations'.
- (-) "Privacy advocates and enthusiasts": these are the
- (-) Incoherence between "activists, journalists" and "everybody"
  influencers, not the final audience.
- (!=) Audience: just anybody when you need some extra privacy
