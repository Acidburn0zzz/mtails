Each month Tails contributors gather for an online meeting in which
everybody is welcome to attend: existing contributors and those who want
to become one.

- **Date**:
  - The **3rd** day of the month if Monday to Thursday
  - The **6th** day of the month otherwise
- **Time**: 8pm CEST or CET (6pm or 7pm UTC)
- **Location**: [[`tails-dev` XMPP chatroom|contribute/chat]]

Feel free to propose and prepare discussion topics:

  - Update the [[blueprint of the agenda|blueprint/monthly_meeting]].

  - Make sure that the discussion tickets that you want to treat during the
    meeting are well detailed on Redmine.

If you want to get involved but don't know yet how, please introduce
yourself during the meeting, and be sure to tell us what you are
interested in.

The meeting might not be the most adequate time and place to properly
introduce newcomers to the development process, but at least it should
be a fine place to know each others, and schedule a better suited event.

# Instructions for taking notes

  - Explain in details the decisions that were taken.
  - Keep track of the brainstorming that we did if no decision was
    taken.
  - Include names of people who took responsibilities.
  - Update Redmine tickets accordingly and point them to the meeting
    notes (unless someone else volunteers to do it on some tickets).
  - Remove from the [[blueprint of the agenda|blueprint/monthly_meeting]]
    all topics that don't require further discussion.
