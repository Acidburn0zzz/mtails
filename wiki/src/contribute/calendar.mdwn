# 2020Q1

* 2020-01-07: **Release 4.2** (Firefox 68.4, bugfix release, with one exception — intrigeri is the RM)
  - Support for [[!tails_ticket 15281 desc="Endless automatic upgrades"]]
    in Tails Upgrader
  - Automatic upgrade from 4.0 and 4.1, using the old upgrade system

* 2020-01-08 to 2020-01-10: Illustration sprint

* 2019-01-12, 17:00: Fundraising meeting

* 2020-02-05 to 2020-02-12: Accounting & management sprint

* 2020-02-11: **Release 4.3** (Firefox 68.5, bugfix release — anonym is the RM, intrigeri in the backup RM and helps with upgrades)

  Automatic upgrade from 4.2, using the new upgrade system (but still
  with an aufs-based diff).

  From now on, users of Tails << 4.2 must first automatically upgrade
  to 4.2, before they can automatically upgrade to the current 4.x.
  Alternatively, they can do a manual upgrade. UX will tell RMs which
  of these options we should advertise.

* 2020-03-10: **Release 4.4** (Firefox 68.6, bugfix release — kibi is the RM)

  Automatic upgrade from 4.2 and newer (still with aufs-based diff).

* 2020-03-21: potential emergency release that traditionally follows
  [pwn2own](https://cansecwest.com/) (March 18-20)

* late 2020-03: Release 4.5~rc1 (assuming [[!tails_ticket 17376]] is done
  by then: kibi is the RM, anonym is around to help if needed as it's
  the first RC that kibi releases)

  - Switch to overlayfs ([[!tails_ticket 8415]])
  - If [[!tails_ticket 15806 desc="GRUB"]] and [[!tails_ticket 6560 desc="Secure Boot"]]
    are ready to ship as well: awesome! Otherwise, we'll need another
    major release by the end of July.
  - Automatic upgrade from 4.2 and newer (now with overlayfs-based diff).
