The big picture
===============

Upstream
--------

For this package, "upstream" means, from a Debian packaging
point-of-view, the state of our upstream branches.  Tails developers are
the upstream for this forked version of liveusb-creator, which, from
version 4.x on, has been renamed to tails-installer.

The `master` branch must always be the one that targets current Tails.
At the moment it supports Tails based on Debian Stretch, Buster and Sid.

But that's not enough, since we also need to put releases out with code
that works on current Debian testing/unstable. Thus, we maintain several upstream
release branches in parallel, each with their own major version number:

 * for work and releases that target Stretch (and, as long
   as compatible, that target Debian testing/unstable as well):
   * branch = `master`
   * version = `5.*`
   * tag = `tails-installer_5.*`

Once we can't support both Stretch and Debian testing/unstable
with the same codebase anymore, we'll fork a new upstream release
branch that targets Debian testing, it'll be called
`feature/$codename` (i.e. feature/bullseye), use version `6.*`, etc.


Packaging
---------

We're using [DEP-14 conventions](http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep14/),
except for our `master` branch which is used for upstream development
targeted at current Tails, as said above. More specifically:

* The `pristine-tar` branch contains the binary delta between DFSG-freed
  tarballs and the corresponding tag. It's automatically maintained by
  `gbp import-orig`.
* The `tails/master` branch is used to prepare packages that we upload
  to the Tails APT repo for Tails stable releases, but not to Debian.
* The `tails/$codename` branch is used to prepare packages that we upload
  to the Tails APT repo but for (non-stable) Tails based on Debian
  `$codename`. Again, these packages will not be uploaded to Debian.
* Additionally, we use `tails/$feature` branches for other
  Tails-specific packaging branches.
* The `upstream/4.x+dfsg`, `upstream/5.x+dfsg`, etc. branches are what
  we tell `gbp` to use as its "upstream" branch. Make sure to check
  them out when setting up the repository for the first time.

Branches that are not used anymore because the package was dropped from
Debian, but stay in the packaging repository for reference:

* The `debian/sid` branch was used to build the package that we uploaded to
  Debian unstable. The tags on this branch were called `debian/$package_version`.
* The `debian/$codename-backports` branch was used to prepare packages
  that were upload to the official backports repository for Debian `$codename`.
* We did not maintain any Git branches related to Ubuntu releases, as
  simply the changelog entries are modified and the releases tagged.

Topic branches
--------------

In practice, it's expected that Tails contributors submit bugfix and
feature branches forked off `master`, because they want them part of next
Tails release. Hence, it will happen that code lands into `master` first,
and in turn into a new `5.*` upstream release, before it lands into e.g.
`feature/buster` and in turn into a new `6.*` upstream release.

For how to package topic branches (`bugfix/*` and `feature/*`), see
[[the dedicated page|topic_branch]].

Workflow
========

Release a new upstream version
------------------------------

<a id="upstream-prepare"></a>

### Prepare the environment

The new upstream version should be something like `5.3`, based on the
upstream branch you are building the Debian package for. Adjust and
export:

    export NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION=5.replace_me
    export UPSTREAM_DEV_BRANCH=master
    export PKG_NAME=tails-installer

<a id="upstream-tag"></a>

### Tag the new version

    git checkout "$UPSTREAM_DEV_BRANCH" && \
    ./setup.py build && \
       (cd po && \
           for po in *.po ; do msgmerge --update "$po" \
           "$PKG_NAME.pot" ; done \
       ) && \
       git commit po -m 'Update POT and PO files.' && \
    git tag \
       -s "${PKG_NAME}_${NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION}" \
       -m "Releasing Tails Installer $NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION" && \
    git push --tags origin "$UPSTREAM_DEV_BRANCH"

<a id="upstream-tarball"></a>

### Generate a new upstream tarball

    mkdir -p ../tarballs && \
    git archive \
       --prefix="${PKG_NAME}-${NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION}/" \
       --output="../tarballs/${PKG_NAME}_${NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION}.tar.gz" \
       "$UPSTREAM_DEV_BRANCH"

<a id="tails-package"></a>

Update the Debian package for Tails
-----------------------------------

Checkout the packaging branch, e.g.:

	export PKG_NAME=tails-installer
	export PACKAGING_BRANCH=tails/master
	git checkout "$PACKAGING_BRANCH"

Here we assumed that `tails/master` still supports Debian Sid,
otherwise `PACKAGING_BRANCH` should be `tails/${codename}`.

Merge Debian packaging changes:

    git fetch debian && \
    codename="${PACKAGING_BRANCH/*\//}" && \
    if [ "${codename}" = "master" ]; then
        codename=sid
    fi && \
    git merge "debian/debian/${codename}"

Verify that `debian/gbp.conf` references the correct upstream and Debian (packaging) branches,
and that `pristine-tar` usage is enabled, e.g.:

	[DEFAULT]
	upstream-branch = upstream/5.x+dfsg
	debian-branch = tails/${codename}
	debian-tag = tails/%(version)s
	pristine-tar = True

Extract the upstream and packaging branch from gbp.conf:

	export UPSTREAM_BRANCH=$(gbp config buildpackage.upstream-branch \
                             | sed -r -e 's,.*=,,')

Create a DFSG-compatible tarball from the previously created Git
archive and reimport it into the source tree. This merges, into the
`debian-branch` specified in `gbp.conf`, not only the commit that
imported the current DFSG-free upstream tarball into the
`upstream-branch`, but also the corresponding upstream Git history:

	mk-origtargz \
	   -C ../tarballs \
	   --version "$NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION+dfsg" \
	   --copy \
	   ../tarballs/${PKG_NAME}_${NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION}.tar.* && \
	gbp import-orig \
	   --upstream-vcs-tag="${PKG_NAME}_$NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION" \
	   ../tarballs/${PKG_NAME}_${NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION}+dfsg.orig.tar.*

Update `debian/changelog`:

    gbp dch && dch -e

The raw data compiled by `gbp dch` must be edited to convey
information that's relevant and self-contained for a Debian audience
(clearly our upstream commit messages are not written with this
audience in mind). For example, the 5.0.4+dfsg-0tails1 changelog entry
is pretty good, but things like "Apply awful hack to fix Tails#14755"
are meaningless for a Debian audience.

Also:

* Set the appropriate version number, such as `5.3+dfsg-0tails1`; in
  particular, note that the Debian revision starts with `-0` for any
  package meant for the Tails APT repository, while the first package
  that will be uploaded to Debian will have `-1`;
* Set the appropriate target release name.

Commit the changelog:

    git commit debian/changelog \
        -m "$(echo "$(dpkg-parsechangelog -SSource) ($(dpkg-parsechangelog -SVersion))\n\nGit-Dch: Ignore\n")"

Make sure that the working environment is clean:

    git clean -fdx

Build a new Tails package (use a amd64 chroot that matches the target distribution):

    gbp buildpackage

Add a signed tag to the Git repository and push the changes:

    gbp buildpackage --git-tag-only --git-sign-tags && \
    git push --tags origin "$UPSTREAM_BRANCH" \
                    "$PACKAGING_BRANCH" \
                    pristine-tar

Add the Debian package to Tails
-------------------------------

Sign the package:

    debsign $CHANGES_FILE

Upload:

    dupload --to tails $CHANGES_FILE
