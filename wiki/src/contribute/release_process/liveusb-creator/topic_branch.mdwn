[[!meta title="Packaging liveusb-creator topic branches"]]

Let's say your branch is `feature/$TOPIC`, then you package it as
follows:

1. `export TARGET_DIST="tails/jessie"`
2. `git checkout -b debian_$TOPIC $TARGET_DIST`
3. `git merge feature/$TOPIC`
4. Use `gbp dch --auto --snapshot --ignore-branch` to fill `debian/changelog`, and
   insert something like "+feature.$TOPIC.1bugfix-6092-drop-racy-code" (with all special
   characters changed to full stops, i.e. ".") between the version
   last packaged in the TARGET_DIST branch, and the gbp snapshot number
   (that looks like "~1.gbpNNNNNN"). In the end, if `$TOPIC =
   7000-blah-bleh` it should look something like:
   3.11.6+tails1-4+feature.7000.blah.bleh~1.gbp4a0c9c
4. Verify the changelog manually then commit:
   
       git commit debian/changelog
   
6. Build with `gbp buildpackage --git-ignore-branch`.
