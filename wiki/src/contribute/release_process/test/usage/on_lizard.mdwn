[[!meta title="Running the automated test suite on Lizard."]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Core developers have access to the isotester1 VM on lizard which is
configured to run our automated test suite. They can run it there on the
ISOs build by Jenkins.


# Accessing isotester1

Developers have ssh access to Lizard and can `ssh isotester1.lizard`
from there. They can also access it with ssh directly using its Tor
hidden service. They have privileges to run the test suite using sudo.

A Tails git repo is already cloned in `/srv/git/`.


# Fetching the ISOs

The automated build ISOs can be quickly retrieved from within the
isotester by using wget to download them from their
http://nightly.tails.boum.org/ URL.


# Running the test suite

Snapshots and captured images are stored in /tmp/TailsToaster.

Developers that want to use the --capture option to have a webm video of
the tests should store them in that directory too for it has more
storage space than the system partition, e.g by using:

    ./run_test_suite --capture /tmp/TailsToaster/capture.webm [...]

The vnc display of the tested Tails ISO can be accessed using a ssh
tunnel.
