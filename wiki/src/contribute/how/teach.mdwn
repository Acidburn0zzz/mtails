[[!meta title="Teach Tails"]]

Many people want to learn to use Tails, but we don't provide Tails
training: we don't have the time or teaching skills to do so. However,
other people do teach Tails usage.

Teaching organizations
======================

We list here some organizations and people providing Tails
training. This list is not exhaustive. We don't have any monetary or
technical implications in their Tails trainings, we just provide this
list for the benefit of users willing to learn about Tails. If you
provide Tails training, please write to <tails-press@boum.org> and
we'll complete this list :)
