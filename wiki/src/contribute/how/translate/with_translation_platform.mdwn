[[!meta title="Translate Tails using the Tails translation platform"]]

The Tails website, which includes the Tails [[documentation|doc]], can
be translated using the [[Tails translation
platform|https://translate.tails.boum.org]]. Using this platform is
easy: you are not required to set up complicated tools to start
translating.

The Tails translation platform is an instance of
[[Weblate|https://weblate.org/]], and the full documentation for
translators is available on the [[Translators
guide|https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/index.html]].

Below you will find instructions on how to get started.

# Create and configure an account

In order to use the Tails translation platform to translate Tails to your
language, you first need to create and configure an account:

- First, access the [[registration
  page|https://translate.tails.boum.org/accounts/register/]].
- Fill the form with an **E-mail** address, a **Username**, a **Full
  name** and the answer to the mathematical question to prove you're not
  a spammer robot. There's no need to use your real name here, you
  can even repeat the username in the full name field.
- Click the **Register** button.
- Check your e-mail inbox, you should receive a message by
  **root@tails.translate.boum.org** with a verification link to activate
  your account.
- Access that link and choose a new passphrase for your account. You
  should leave the **Current password** field empty if you have just
  activated the account and it's the first time you set up a password
  for this account.
- Configure the languages you want to work with in the translation
  platform. The languages you select in **Translated languages** will
  appear on your dashboard on the website so it's easier for you to access
  them. **Secondary languages** will be shown as references during
  translation to try to make your work easier.
- Click **Save**.

# Explore the Dashboard

On the Tails translation platform, a *translation component* corresponds to the
translation of one page of the Tails website to a specific language. The
translation platform will only show components for the languages you have
configured on your account.

The **Dashboard** is the first page that appears when you log in to the Tails
translation platform. It offers different views of translation components for
the languages you have configured. It contains a series of useful tabs, in the
following order:

- **Watched translations:** lists the components you have selected to
  watch.
- **Your languages:** lists all components registered in the platform
  for your configured languages.
- **Suggested translations:** **FIXME**
- **core pages:** lists most important components to be translated, as
  selected by the Tails translation team.
- **Persistence:** lists components of the *Encrypted persistence*
  section of the Tails documentation.
- **Install & upgrade:** lists components of the *Download and install
  Tails* section of the Tails website.
- **First steps:** lists components of the *First steps with Tails*
  section of the Tails documentation.
- **Anonymous internet:** lists components of the *Connect to the
  Internet anonymously* section of the Tails documentation.
- **Insights:** gives you access to the history, activity and statistics
  of the translation platform.
- **Tools:** gives you access to search and other information about the
  contents of the Tails translation platform.

In all tabs that list translation components, you will see the same columns
with information about each of the listed components:

 - **Project:** lists the full name of the component, which should match
   it's place in the Tails website.
 - **Translated:** shows the percentage of strings in the component that
   are already translated.
 - **Words:** shows the percentage of words in the component that are
   already translated.
 - **Review:** shows the percentage of strings in the component that are
   waiting for review.
 - **Checks:** shows the number of strings in the component that the
   system identified as needing to be verified. The list of things to
   check will appear in the component view on top of the right column.
 - **Suggestions:** shows the number of strings in the component that
   have suggestions that need to be evaluated.

As you move around and start translating, each of the above will become more
clear.

# Explore a component

As stated above, a *translation component* in the Tails translation platform
corresponds to the translation of one page of the Tails website to a specific
language. The *component overview* gives access to the translation status of
that component and the strings that need to be checked.

To access a *component overview*, start from the Dashboard, select one of the
tabs (as explained in the previous section), and click the name of the
component in the left column of the components table. From the component
overview page, you can go to the different translation pages for untranslated
strings, strings marked as needing editing, strings with suggestions, etc. You can
also go directly from the Dashboard to the different translation pages of
a component by clicking on the links on the other columns of the component
table.

Find your way around. The translation platform might look a bit full of
corners at first, but once you get used to the different ways through
which you can reach the translation workflow you'll start getting
translation work done.

# Explore the translation page with different lists of strings

In order to start translating, you have to access one of the different
translation pages either from the component overview page, or directly from the
Dashboard columns of the components list (see the previous section).

The translation page of a component can show different lists of strings. Once
you are in the translation page of a component, the top bar allows you to
navigate back and forth in the list of strings and informs you the list being
shown, which can be one of the following:

  - All strings.
  - Translated strings.
  - Strings needing action.
  - Not translated strings.
  - Strings with suggestions.
  - Strings with any failing checks.

If you want to work on a specific subset of strings, you can select one of the
lists above if they are available for the component you are working with.
Otherwise, you can click the **Translate** button (either in the component
overview page or in the component list table on the Dashboard page), and it'll
take you to the *Strings needing action* translation page.

# Suggest or vote translations

On the Tails translation platform, you can always either *suggest* a new
translation or *vote* for an already suggested translation. A string is only
accepted when there are two votes for it (the initial suggestion counts as
one vote), and there is no way to directly save your translation. This is
intentional, to make sure that mandatory peer review happens before getting new
translations accepted.

In order to *suggest* a new translation, access a component translation page as
described in the last section, fill or modify the **Translation** field in the
*Translate* box, and then click **Suggest**. You will be automatically taken to
the next string in the list that you are currently accessing.

In order to *vote* for or against a string, find a component with suggestions
in the Dashboard and either click directly in the number of suggestions in the
component list or access the component overview page and then click *Strings
with suggestions*. You will be taken to the respective component translation
page. In the tabs below the *Translate* box, click **Suggestions**, and you'll
be presented with a list of suggestions for that string. Evaluate the
suggestion carefully, and then choose to either *Vote for*, *Vote against*, or
even *Delete* the suggestion. After choosing, the suggestion will be shown as
the new translation of the string, and you will have to navigate to the next
string manually.

# Missing to cover in this documentation

- how to ask for a new language to be added (I think we should not add too many languages, because we will carry all PO files around with us, and this will become heavy if people start to translate one single page to a rare language. There should be a real interest in having a new language)
- where can they see their translations (staging wiki)
- explain to people when their language will be activated on the main site (point to this part of the doc on wiki/src/contribute/how/translate)
- how to get in contact when they experience technical problems
- suggest they work in a team
- suggest they create a glossary
- how to use weblate itself and it's translation memory
- link their questions to tails-l10n
- eventually link to the blueprint for people who want to know more about our setup (although this blueprint needs some love and is currently lagging behind)
- other things?
