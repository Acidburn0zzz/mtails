# What can be translated

* **This website** must be translated in the `master` branch of the
  [main Tails Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/).
  Please read the documentation about [[translating with
  Git|translate/with_Git]] first.

* Spanish translation files are not part of main Tails repository, so we
  have our own repo until we get a bigger proportion of the website translated:

  https://git-tails.immerda.ch/weblate/tails/ branch: master

* You can create an account on the weblate interface:
  https://translate.tails.boum.org/ and introduce yourself on the mailing list.

# Workflow

* We try to translate using Tails itself so we get familiarised with the
  software we are translating.
* We have one main communication channel: A [mailing list](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n-spanish)
  (<tails-l10n-spanish@boum.org>)
* Sometimes we hang out on the tails-dev chatroom.
* We use Poedit (https://poedit.net/) for the translations (comes with Tails)
* The first documents to translate should be the 'core pages':
  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/l10n_tricks/core_po_files.txt
  or inside weblate: https://translate.tails.boum.org/#list-core

If you want to contribute, please contact us first through the mailing list.
