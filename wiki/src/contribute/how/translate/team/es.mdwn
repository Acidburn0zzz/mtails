[[!meta title="Translate Tails into Spanish"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

* We try to translate using Tails itself so we get familiarised with the
  software we are translating.
* We have one main communication channel: A [mailing list](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n-spanish)
  (<tails-l10n-spanish@boum.org>)
* We have a wiki: https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/l10n_Spanish/
* We use Poedit (https://poedit.net/) for the translations (comes with Tails)
* The first documents to translate should be the 'core pages':
  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/l10n_tricks/core_po_files.txt
  or inside weblate: https://translate.tails.boum.org/#list-core

If you want to contribute, please contact us first through the mailing list.
