    - Add screenshots of cool stuff
      - Resize them to 66% if needed
    - Document manual steps that persistence users may need to go
      through, taking into account that we support automatic updates
      from the two last releases (not mentioning manual updates).
      It may imply to refer to, or copy from, such instructions that
      were documented in the _previous_ release notes.
  - Write the draft
    - Use full sentences for major changes ("*We installed*", "*You can*")
    - Use present tense without subject for minor changes ("*Upgrade*", "*Fix*")
    - Mention updates as "Update *Xyz* to [1.2.4]."
      - Mention previous version if we skipped some "Update Xyz from 1.0.0 to [1.2.3]."
      - Link to release notes if any, or changelog
    - Order items to put the most visible, less technical, and most popular
      items first while not being afraid of putting more technical items as
      well down the list.
  - Format
    - Link to ticket for fixed problems and changes that are well justified in Redmine
    - Put the period before ticket number
      - "Bla bla. ([!tails_ticket 1234])"
  - Prepare a tweet with highlights:
    - Tails x.y is out: https://tails.boum.org/news/version_x.y, bla bla bla, and more.
    - Add it as a comment to the ticket for the release notes.
