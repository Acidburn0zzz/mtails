[[!meta title="Promote Tails"]]

<div id="intro">

<p>The Tails project needs more contributors.</p>

<p>Tor users' anonymity needs more users.</p>

<p>You can help by promoting Tails for instance to:

<ul>
<li>people who need privacy while using computers</li>
<li>people who might want to helpfully contribute to Tails</li>
<li>people who themselves should be advertising Tails :)</li>
</ul>

It all depends on who you happen to meet, what they are interested in,
