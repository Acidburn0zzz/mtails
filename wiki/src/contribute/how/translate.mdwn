# For native English speakers

Most of Tails developers are not native English speakers so you're
more than welcome to correct or improve our English.
For this, you can either follow the [[Git workflow|translate/with_Git]] or
propose on [[tails-dev@boum.org|about/contact#tails-dev]] another way that suits you better to share
your improvements with us.

# Translate Tails custom programs

You can help correct, improve, or complete the translations of Tails
programs into your native language. Read [[translating with Transifex|translate/with_Transifex]].
Tails programs can be translated into more than 140 languages this way.

# Translate this website

You can also translate this website, which includes the Tails
[[documentation|doc]]. This is done [[on the translation
platform|translate/with_translation_platform]] or, for a more technical
approach, [[using Git|translate/with_Git]].

The translations are peer-reviewed and thus, you need to get into contact with
a language team if you want to participate.
In general, you can contact the translation teams via the
[[mailing list for translators|translate#follow-up]].

Translators should focus on translating and maintaining the
[[core pages|contribute/l10n_tricks/core_po_files.txt]] first, then on
the rest of the website.

<a id="language-teams"></a>

Currently, there are several active **language teams**:

* [[Catalan|translate/team/ca]]
* [[Chinese (Simplified)|translate/team/zh]]
* [[Farsi|translate/team/fa]]
* [[French|translate/team/fr]]
* [[German|translate/team/de]]
* [[Portuguese|translate/team/pt]]
* [[Italian|translate/team/it]]
* [[Spanish|translate/team/es]]

Other teams are being set up:

* Turkish

If your language is not listed here, read the documentation
to [[add a new language|translate/team/new]].

Tier-1 languages
================

We call "tier-1 languages" the languages that we consider the most
important for our target user base:

- Languages proposed on our website
- Languages that make Tails understandable by a majority of the
  population of the top 10 countries of either
  - [Directly-connecting Tor clients](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-table.html)
  - [Tor clients connecting via bridges](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-bridge-table.html)

In March 2019 this list was:

- Arabic
- English
- Farsi
- French
- German
- Hindi
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Simplified Chinese
- Spanish
- Turkish

We are particularly interested in translations in these languages and
include language packs and dictionaries by default in Tails for them.
