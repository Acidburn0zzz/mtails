<p>These personas are fictitious but concrete representations of the people
using Tails. We use these personas to keep in mind who we are working for, what
are their needs, and what Tails should do for them.</p>

<p>These personas come from collective discussions about who we want to help
when building Tails, [[interviews with users|blueprint/interviews]], and other
sources of information about Internet freedom.</p>
