[[!meta title="Tails Verification (browser extension)"]]

Software verification is a critical step in the use of secure
applications but it has traditionally been hard to provide, especially
from a user perspective. Usual solutions are:

  - Using HTTPS to download. But in the case of Tails, we are serving so
    many downloads that we have to rely on mirrors hosted by third
    parties.
  - Providing OpenPGP signatures. But this really works only for the few
    people who know how to verify an OpenPGP signature and use the
    OpenPGP Web-of-Trust correctly.

We are trying here to provide a usable solution to verify a download
done through HTTP, while relying on cryptographic information fetched
elsewhere through HTTPS (and possibly with stronger authentication
mechanisms such as public key pinning from browser vendors).

We use for that a browser extension, called
*Tails Verification* which is available for:

* Firefox 45+ (and Tor Browser 6+)
* Chrome 22+

The code of *Tails Verification* is available in <https://git-tails.immerda.ch/verification-extension>.

Scope
=====

Goals
-----

Provide a simple, automated, and cross-platform technique to verify the ISO
image of the current version.

Non goals
---------

  - Verify deprecated ISO images.
  - Verify ISO images downloaded from nightly.tails.boum.org.
  - Verify ISO images downloaded through BitTorrent. If we can rely on
    our website to provide a correct cryptographic description of the
    ISO image then we can rely on it as well to provide a correct
    BitTorrent file. Then we rely on the BitTorrent client to verify the integrity of
    the download ([[!tails_ticket 9043]]).

ISO verification mechanism
==========================

Threat model
------------

We are considering here an attacker who can:

  - (A) Provide a malicious ISO image to the user for example by
    operating a rogue Tails mirror.

  - (H) Operate a website that is loaded in a different tab in the same
    browser as the extension. See the section on [[security inside the
    browser|verification_extension#inside_the_browser]].

We are not considering an attacker who can:

  - (B) Do a man-in-the-middle attack by providing a rogue HTTPS certificate
    for https://tails.boum.org/ signed by a certificate authority
    trusted by the
    browser but under the control of the attacker.

    Since the extension is targeted at new users, a MitM or exploit on
    our website could defeat any verification technique by providing
    simplified instructions or by faking ISO verification.

    To mitigate such an attack we should work on deploying HPKP (HTTP
    Public Key Pinning) which provides TOFU on our SSL certificate
    ([[!tails_ticket 9026]]). But our certificate could also probably be
    integrated in the Firefox preload list shipped with the browser
    ([[!tails_ticket 9027]]).

  - (C) Insert malicious content on https://tails.boum.org/ through an
    exploit on our website as this could trick new users to skip the ISO
    verification all the way. To prevent this kind of attack we should
    instead:

    - Monitor externally the most relevant parts of our website.
    - Work on integrating full upgrades in Tails Upgrader to limit the
      number of times people have to rely on our website to upgrade. See
      [[!tails_ticket 7499]].

  - (D) Insert malicious information in our main Git repository as such
    an attacker could do attack (C) as well.

  - (E) Insert targeted malware on the user's computer as this could
    defeat any possible verification mechanism that such an extension
    could do.

  - (F) Provide a rogue extension to the user as this could defeat any
    possible verification mechanism that such an extension could do.

  - (G) Insert malicious content on https://tails.boum.org/ after taking
    control of the web server, or entire system, behind it. Such an
    attacker could do attack (C) as well but in such a way that could be
    much harder to detect (for example by serving malicious content only to
    some users).

    To mitigate such an attack in some cases we could both:

    - Encourage external documentation (screencasts on YouTube, printed
      forms, etc.). But those would be vulnerable to other kind of
      attacks.
    - Not rely on the website to perform the ISO verification and rely
      on a native interface accessible from the add-ons menu.

    But the cost/benefit of such a technique is not very appealingâ€¦

  - [I] Provide a malicious extension in the same browser as this would
    have similar effects to attack [F].

<a id="inside_the_browser"></a>

Security inside the browser
---------------------------

The threat described as [H] is taken care of by the internals of the
browser (and the proper coding of the extension). Web pages from a
different origin cannot interfere in any way with the result of the
verification performed by the extension. Only tabs from the same origin,
or if the content of the other tab opts-in for some form of cross-domain
communication, or it's been opened with `window.open()` by a script in
this tab or vice-versa. In the latter cases it has a handle to the
window of the other tab, either as the return value of `window.open()` or
as the `window.opener` property, but it cannot actually touch the content
unless it's same domain.

Of course, any tab can open an alert box saying "Verification
Successful", but it cannot overlay a different tab and, most important,
it cannot detect any hint that the verification is happening. Note that the
proposed wireframe for the extension does not open alert boxes but
instead modifies the content of the page.

Bugs in the browser itself that could temper with the verification
mechanism would need to be of the "remote code execution vulnerability"
and would represent a threat in many more use cases than when verifying
an ISO image.

Checksum verification
---------------------

When verifying an ISO image, the extension:

  - Connects to https://tails.boum.org/.
  - Downloads an ISO description document (size, checksum).
  - Verifies the ISO image against the document (first its size, then
    its checksum).

Security properties:

  - This technique would defeat attack A (malicious ISO).

More complex verification mechanisms could be gradually [[built into
Tails Installer|blueprint/bootstrapping/installer]] where we can
defeat attacks B, C, D, F, and G.

<a id="html">

HTML and CSS code
=================

The extension manipulates the HTML code of the [[!tails_gitweb
wiki/src/install/download desc="download page"]] (also embedded in the
different installation scenarios. Here
are some important parts of this code.

### Extension version

The HTML code includes a tag to force a version of the extension.
For example:

<pre>
&lt;div id="extension-version"&gt;1.0&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

We provide only one version of the download page at a time. So the
extension checks the value of this tag and asks for an upgrade if its
version is lower than the request version number.

<a id="data_source">

### CSS

The code of the extension does not include any user-visible string or
graphics but instead manipulates what's displayed on the page through
[[!tails_gitweb wiki/src/install/inc/stylesheets/dave.css desc="a CSS with a set of states"]].

Data source
===========

Building up on the format specified for [[upgrade description
files|contribute/design/incremental_upgrades#upgrade-description-files]],
the verification extension fetches an [[!tails_gitweb wiki/src/install/v1/Tails/i386/stable/latest.yml desc="ISO description file"]] from our
server to retrieve all the information it needs about the ISO image
(URL, size, checksum, etc.). As a beginning, this ISO description file
is not signed using OpenPGP.

### Example of an ISO description file

<a id="update"></a>

Updates mechanism
=================

Firefox checks for updates of the extension once per day on a secure
channel (the update pings are also used to generate add-ons usage
stats). Tor Browser doesn't prevent those updates [except for Torbutton
and Tor Launcher](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2015-April/000258.html).

<a id="technology"></a>

Extension technology
====================

The extension is written as a *Add-on SDK* to be compatible with
Electrolysis, extend its lifespan, and make its code easier to port to
Chrome in the future.

*Add-on SDK* was the only valid option amongst the different technologies
available to write Firefox extensions:

  A. *XUL/XPCOM* requires restarting the browser after
     installing the extension and will be deprecated at some point as
     Firefox wants to move out of XUL/XPCOM in general.

  A. *Bootstrapped* add-ons are restartless but still uses XPCOM so will
     get deprecated as well.

  A. *Add-on SDK* add-ons are restartless as well and use a pure-JS sandboxed
     abstraction. They will be automatically ready for Electrolysis, the
     new multi-thread paradigm of Firefox. By being pure JS and not
     depending on XUL/XPCOM their code will be easier to port to Chrome.

  A. *WebExtensions* is a future technology that will use a pure JS API
     partially shared between Firefox and Google Chrome. They will be
     restartless and ready for Electrolysis as well. But this API is not
     stable yet and lacks some mechanisms that our extension would need.
