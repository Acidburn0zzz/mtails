The *Unsafe Browser* is not using Tor and is not
anonymous.

**Only use the *Unsafe Browser* to log in to captive
portals.**

For a safe and anonymous browser, use *Tor Browser*
instead.

Logging in to captive portals
-----------------------------

[[!inline pages="doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser/captive_portal.inline" raw="yes" sort="age"]]

To log in to a captive portal:

1. Try visiting any website using the *Unsafe Browser*.

   Choose a website that is common in your location, for example a search
   engine or news site.

1. You should be redirected to the captive portal instead of the
   website.

1. After you logged in to the captive portal, Tor should start.

1. After Tor is ready, close the *Unsafe Browser*.

   You can use *Tor Browser* and any other application as usual.
