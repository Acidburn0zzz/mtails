### PNY

<!--
Last updated: 2014-08-02
PNY is quite popular among WB reporters:
-->

When installing Tails, PNY USB sticks have problems with the constant write load
and are prone to failure.

<a id="aegis"></a>

### Aegis

* Aegis Secure Key USB 2.0

During the boot process, USB is briefly powered off, that causes Aegis hardware-encrypted USB sticks to lock down, and the PIN must be entered again (fast) in order to complete the boot.

* Aegis Secure Key USB 3.0

This USB stick doesn't start Tails at all, the USB 2.0 workaround is not working for that hardware.

* MacBook Pro 2016 and 2017: the keyboard, trackpad and Touch Bar do
  not work.

* MacBook Pro 5,1 17" (Nvidia GeForce 9400M): one must add the
  `nouveau.noaccel=1` boot parameter so that the display
  works properly.

* MacBook Air 3,2 (A1369 EMC 2392) freezes when booting Tails in
  UEFI mode.

* Mac Pro Tower and MacBook Pro 4,1 (both from early 2008)
  fails to start on Tails.

These machines do not start on USB sticks
due to a firmware limitation.

A workaround for some of these machines is to use the [[manual
installation process|install/linux/usb]].
Note, however, that this technique does not allow you to set up
a persistent volume.

This problem might be corrected in Tails 1.1 and newer: please report
your test results back to us.

### System76 Oryx Pro

This machine does not start from a Tails USB stick: the Linux kernel
included in at least Tails 3.11 to 3.13.1, inclusive, does not support
the hardware USB controller.

Wi-Fi issues
============

[[!inline pages="doc/anonymous_internet/networkmanager/no-wifi.inline" raw="yes" sort="age"]]

* Check in the following sections
  if there is a workaround to get your Wi-Fi interface work in Tails.

<a id="wi-fi-workarounds"></a>

Knowing the model of your Wi-Fi interface
-----------------------------------------

1. Open <span class="application">Terminal</span> and execute the following command:

       lspci -v | grep "Network controller"

88W8897 [AVASTAR] 802.11ac Wireless
-----------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2018-09-19
-->

On some computers with a Marvell Avastar 88W8897 Wi-Fi adapter, such
as some Microsoft Surface Pro models, Tails fails to connect to
Wi-Fi networks.

If you experience this problem, you can try to [[disable MAC address
spoofing|doc/first_steps/startup_options/mac_spoofing]] that sometimes
fixes it.

RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter
---------------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2017-12-24
-->

On some computers with a RTL8723be Wi-Fi adapter, Tails may fail to discover
Wi-Fi networks, may provide unreliable Wi-Fi connections, or may provide poor
Wi-Fi performance.

Most such problems can be solved by adding
[[startup options|/doc/first_steps/startup_options/#boot_loader_menu]].

The exact combination of options that will work depends on the
computer, so try the following instructions until you find
a combination that works for you:

1. Add `rtl8723be.fwlps=0 rtl8723be.ips=0` to the startup options.
2. Add `rtl8723be.ant_sel=1` to the startup options.
3. Add `rtl8723be.ant_sel=2` to the startup options.
4. Add `rtl8723be.ant_sel=1 rtl8723be.fwlps=0 rtl8723be.ips=0`
   to the startup options.
5. Add `rtl8723be.ant_sel=2 rtl8723be.fwlps=0 rtl8723be.ips=0`
   to the startup options.

<a id="broadcom-sta-dkms"></a>

Broadcom Wi-Fi network interface needing `broadcom-sta-dkms`
------------------------------------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2019-01-29
-->

Some Broadcom Wi-Fi interfaces require the
[`wl`](https://wiki.debian.org/wl) driver, provided by the
`broadcom-sta-dkms` Debian package, to work in Tails.

The `wl` driver is not included in Tails because it is proprietary.

You device requires the `wl` driver if it is in the list of devices
supported by the `broadcom-sta-dkms` package on the corresponding
[Debian wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/wl). If you find your device
in the list of supported devices, then it is impossible to use your
Wi-Fi card in Tails.

## Lenovo Legion Y530

<!--
Last updated: 2019-05-10
-->

Wi-Fi adapter does not work.

Adding `modprobe.blacklist=ideapad_laptop` to the
[[startup options|doc/first_steps/startup_options#boot_loader_menu]] fixes the
issue.

Security issues
===============

<a id="video-memory"></a>

Tails does not erase video memory
---------------------------------

Tails doesn't erase the [[!wikipedia Video_RAM_(dual-ported_DRAM) desc="video memory"]] yet.
When one uses Tails, then restarts the computer into another operating
system, that other operating system can see what has been displayed on
the screen within Tails.

Shutting down the computer completely, instead of restarting it,
might allow the video memory to empty itself.

See [[!tails_ticket 5356 desc="Erase video memory on shutdown"]].

<a id="fails-to-shutdown"></a>

Tails fails to completely shutdown or restart
---------------------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2013-03-13
-->

When stopping Tails on some hardware, the memory wipe procedure fails to
complete: the display gets scrambled, but the computer doesn't
completely shutdown or restart. Sometimes the caps-lock button light of
the keyboard flashes.

<div class="caution">

When this happens, there is no guarantee that the memory is wiped entirely.

</div>

Other issues
============

<a id="chainloading"></a>

Chainloading Tails from GRUB
----------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2014-04-09
-->

To workaround problems in booting Tails on laptops with UEFI support, it is
possible to chainload the syslinux on the ISO image from another boot loader
that is already working on the laptop, like GRUB. Be careful not to modify at
all the options of syslinux in the process.

The following commands, run from the GRUB shell, might be helpful:

    set root=(hd1)
    chainloader +1
    boot

Boot Loader Menu has display issues
-----------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2014-06-27
-->

Since Tails 1.1, on some hardware (ThinkPad X230, MacBook Pro 8,1),
the Boot Loader Menu is not displayed properly. Tails starts fine, though.

Tails fails to connect to certain Wi-Fi networks
------------------------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2012-11-10
-->

This might be related to the introduction of wireless regulation support
in Tails 0.13.

The desktop crashes when run with the default QEMU emulated processor
---------------------------------------------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2015-12-31
-->

Due to a [bug in llvmpipe](https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/34445/), when
Tails runs in a QEMU virtual machine with the default emulated CPU,
the GNOME desktop crashes after login.

To workaround this problem, pass @-cpu host@ on the QEMU command-line.
If you use <span class="application">libvirt</span>, choose <span
class="guilabel">Copy host CPU configuration</span> in <span
class="application">virt-manager</span>'s processor configuration screen.

Touchpad configurations

    synclient FingerLow=5;
    synclient FingerHigh=5;

Bluetooth devices don't work
----------------------------

Bluetooth is not enabled in Tails for security reasons.

<a id="browser_languages"></a>

Tor Browser is translated in a limited number of languages
----------------------------------------------------------

Since Tails 1.2, the web browser is based on Tor Browser which is
translated in less languages than before. You can see the list of
languages available in Tor Browser from the [Tor Browser
homepage](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en).

Playing WebM videos in the Tor Browser fails on old hardware
------------------------------------------------------------

On systems that only have one CPU core, WebM videos may fail to play
in the Tor Browser, and show the error message: "Video can't be played
because the file is corrupt". You can work around this by downloading
the video and watching it in the Totem video player.

<a id="automatic_upgrade_fails"></a>
<a id="partial-upgrade"></a>

Tails fails to start or behaves weirdly after an automatic upgrade
------------------------------------------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2016-09-16
-->

Sometimes, after an automatic upgrade, your Tails might either:

- Fail to start. Often after the message:

  <pre>Loading, please wait...</pre>

- Behave weirdly. For example, your keyboard does not work or you cannot
  connect to a network.

To fix this problem, you can [[update your Tails
manually|doc/first_steps/upgrade/#manual]].

Note that your Persistent Volume will be safely preserved.

<a id="persistence-disappears"></a>

Persistent folder disappears and persistent feature configurations do not load
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, the <span class="filename">Persistent</span> folder is missing and
the configurations for persistent features do not load.

Most likely this means that the <span class="filename">persistence.conf</span>
file has disappeared. However, the files in the
<span class="filename">Persistent</span> folder and the persistent feature
configurations should still be saved.

If you encounter this problem:

1. Enable your encrypted persistent storage in
   <span class="application">Tails Greeter</span> when you start Tails.

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent volume</span></span>.

1. If you are asked to enter a passphrase, enter the same passphrase that you
   used to unlock your persistent storage.

1. Click <span class="button">Save</span>, then restart Tails.

Your <span class="filename">Persistent</span> folder and persistent feature
configurations should be restored.

<a id="restart-shell"></a>

## Icons and information located on the top right corner of the screen disappeared

Sometimes, some of the icons located on the top right corner of the
screen are not displayed entirely, or at all. For example,
the icon that allows to change to another keyboard layout
may be hidden. Other information, such as the clock, may not
be visible.

Press <span class="keycap">Alt+F2</span> and type `r` to restart GNOME
Shell, which often solves this problem.

See [[!tails_ticket 10576]] for more details.

Some languages do not have the correct keyboard layout set by default
---------------------------------------------------------------------

<!--
Last updated: 2017-08-07
-->

When selecting some languages in the Tails Greeter, the default associated
keyboard layout fallbacks to US.

To use the right keyboard layout during a session, set it in the Tails
Greeter after having set the language. When the desktop has started, apply
the keyboard layout by clicking on the `en` systray icon.

Affected language codes are `AYC`, `BHB`, `BRX`, `CMN`, `HAK`, `HNE`, `LIJ`,
`LZH`, `MHR`, `NAN`, `NHN`, `QUZ`, `SGS`, `SHS`, `TCY`, `THE`, `UNM`, `WAE` and
`YUE`.

## The OpenPGP passphrase prompt steals the keyboard and mouse focus

<!--
Last updated: 2018-01-15
-->

This happens when one has enabled the GnuPG persistence feature before
Tails 2.3. To fix this problem, execute the following command in
a
[[terminal|doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop#terminal]]:

	echo "no-grab" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

<a id="utc"></a>

## Problems when the system clock goes backwards

When connecting to Tor, Tails sets the system time to the current time
in the [[!wikipedia Coordinated_Universal_Time]] (UTC) timezone.
Many operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, write time expressed
in UTC to the hardware clock of the computer. But, Windows instead
writes time expressed in the local timezone to the hardware clock of
the computer. So, if you are east of the United Kingdom (which is in the UTC timezone) on
a computer that also runs Windows, Tails will make the system clock go
backwards during startup. Unfortunately, this might trigger software
errors in Tails.

For example, when the system clock goes backwards:

<ul>
<li>The <span class="guimenu">Applications</span> menu might stop
working.</li>
<li>[[Connecting to Tor using `obfs4` bridges|doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]]
might be impossible and <span class="application">Tor Launcher</span>
might get stuck on <span class="guilabel">Loading Network
Consensus</span>.</li>
</ul>

To solve this problem permanently on a Windows computer,
[set the hardware clock of the computer to UTC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_time#UTC_in_Windows).

## Lenovo ThinkPad 11e

<!--
Last updated: 2018-03-22
-->

Tails may be unstable and stop working regularly on some Lenovo
ThinkPad 11e laptops, such as the 2015 model.

To fix this problem, add `intel_idle.max_cstate=1` to the
[[startup options|/doc/first_steps/startup_options/#boot_loader_menu]].

## Acer Aspire One

If the sound output does not work on an Acer Aspire One laptop, add
`snd-hda-intel.model=acer-aspire` to the [[startup
options|/doc/first_steps/startup_options/#boot_loader_menu]].

## Electrum is outdated and cannot connect to servers

[[!inline pages="doc/anonymous_internet/electrum/phishing.inline" raw="yes" sort="age"]]

<a id="usb-gigabyte"></a>

## USB devices are not working on some [GIGABYTE](https://www.gigabyte.com/) motherboards

<!--
Last updated: 2019-06-02
-->

To workaround this issue, you can try to:

- Use other USB ports. For example, use USB 2 ports instead of USB 3
  ports and vice versa.

- Enable these 3 options in the BIOS

  - xHCI handoff
  - EHCI handoff
  - IOMMU controller

- Add the following
  [[startup options|/doc/first_steps/startup_options/#boot_loader_menu]]:

    amd_iommu=on iommu=pt

- Disable IOMMU in the BIOS then enable it again.

Some of these workarounds may disable some of the USB ports.
