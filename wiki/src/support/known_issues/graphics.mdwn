Error starting GDM
==================

This section applies if you see the following error message when
starting Tails:

<p class="pre">
Error starting GDM with your graphics card: <i>name of your graphics
card [id] (rev number)</i>. Please take note of this error and visit
https://tails.boum.org/gdm for troubleshooting.
</p>

1. Identify the name, ID, and revision number (if any) of your graphics card.

   For example, if your error message starts with:

   <p class="pre">Error starting GDM with your graphics card:
   NVIDIA Corporation GT218M [NVS 3100M] [10de:0a6c] (rev a2)</p>

   - The name is *NVIDIA Corporation GT218M [NVS 3100M]*.
   - The ID is *[10de:0a6c]*. The ID is unique to the model of your
     graphics card, it is not unique to your computer.
   - The revision number is *a2*. Your graphics card might have no
     revision number.

1. Check if your graphics card is listed below. For example, you can search for its
   name or ID on this page.

   - If your graphics card is listed, check if a workaround is
     documented to make it work on Tails.

     If the workaround doesn't work, please [[contact our support team by
     email|support/talk]].

     Mention in your email:

     - The version of Tails that you are trying to start.
     - The name, ID, and revision number (if any) of your graphics card.
     - The workaround that you tried and that failed.

   - If your graphics card is not listed, please [[contact our support
     team by email|support/talk]].

     Mention in your email:

     - The version of Tails that you are trying to start.
     - The name, ID, and revision number (if any) of your graphics card.
