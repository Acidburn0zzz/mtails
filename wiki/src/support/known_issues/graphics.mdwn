Error starting GDM
==================

This section applies if you see the following error message when
starting Tails:

<p class="pre">
Error starting GDM with your graphics card: <i>name of your graphics
card [id]</i>. Please take note of this error and visit
https://tails.boum.org/gdm for troubleshooting.
</p>

1. Identify the name and ID of your graphics card.

   For example, if your error message starts with:

   <p class="pre">Error starting GDM with your graphics card: Intel
   Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller
   [8086:0046]</p>

   - The name is *Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics*.
   - The ID is *[8086:0046]*. The ID is unique to the model of your
     graphics card, it is not unique to your computer.

1. Check if your graphics card is listed below by searching for its
   name or ID on this page.

   - If your graphics card is listed, check if a workaround is
     documented to make it work on Tails.

     If the workaround doesn't work, please [[contact our support team by
     email|support/talk]]. Mention in your email:

     - The version of Tails that you are trying to start.
     - The name and ID of your graphics cards.
     - The workaround that you tried and that failed.

   - If your graphics card is not listed, please [[contact our support
     team by email|support/talk]]. Mention in your email:

     - The version of Tails that you are trying to start.
     - The name and ID of your graphics cards.

1. If your problem get fixed in future versions of Tails, please let us
   know so we can update this page.
