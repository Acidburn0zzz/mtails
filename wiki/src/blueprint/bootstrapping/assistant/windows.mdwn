Plug first flash memory
=======================

1. Plug the first flash memory (USB stick or SD card) into the computer.

<div class="caution">

<p>All the data on this flash memory will be lost.</p>

</div>

Because *Tails Installer* is not yet available in Windows, you first
need to install a temporary Tails on a first flash memory using a different
program called *Universal USB Installer*. On this temporary Tails you
won't benefit from important features like automatic upgrades or the
possibility to store some of your personal files. After starting on
this temporary Tails, you will be able to install the final Tails on a second
flash memory using *Tails Installer*.

Although this program is called
<span class="application">Universal USB Installer</span>, you can use it
to copy the ISO image on a SD card.

Copy ISO image on first flash memory
====================================

1. Download <span class="application">Universal USB Installer</span>:

   <a class='download-file' href=https://tails.boum.org/Universal-USB-Installer.exe>Universal USB Installer</a>

1. At the Windows security warning, click **Run** to run *Universal USB
Installer* without saving it.

1. If a second security warning appears, also confirm that you want to
run the program.

1. Read the licence agreement and click **I Agree** to continue and
start <span class="application">Universal USB Installer</span>.

   [[!img /doc/first_steps/installation/manual/windows/04-select-tails.png link=no alt="screenshot of Universal USB Installer"]]

1. Select **Tails** from the drop-down list.

1. Click **Browse** and choose the ISO image that you downloaded earlier.

1. Use the drop-down list to specify the flash memory on which you want to copy
the ISO image.

1. Click **Create**.

1. A confirmation dialog appears. Click **Yes** to start the installation.

1. After the installation is finished, click **Close** to quit *Universal USB
Installer*.

You will now use this first flash memory as a temporary Tails to be able to
install a final Tails on the second flash memory using *Tails Installer*.

Restart on first flash memory
=============================

1. To be able to follow the rest of the instructions after shutting down
your computer, we recommend you either:

Troubleshooting: Tails does not start at all
--------------------------------------------

The following section applies if the **Boot Tails** menu does not
appears when starting Tails.

It is quite common for computers not to start automatically on a
flash memory with Tails installed. Here are few troubleshooting techniques. You should try them
one after the other.

### Getting to the boot menu

On most computer, you can press a *boot menu key* to display a list of possible
devices to start from. The following screenshot is an example of such boot
menu:

[[!img boot_menu.png link=no]]

This section explains how to identify the correct boot menu key on your
computer and how to use it to start Tails.

1. Identify the potential boot menu keys for your computer depending on
your computer manufacturer in the following list:

   <table>

   </table>

1. Make sure the first flash memory is plugged into the computer.

1. Shut down your computer.

1. Hold down the first potential boot menu key identified in step 1
while you switch on your computer.

   - If a boot menu with a list of possible devices to start from
     appears, then select your first flash memory.

   - If you computer starts on your usual operating system, repeat steps
     2 and 3 for all the potential boot menu keys identified in step 1.

### Edit the BIOS settings

If you cannot get to the boot menu, you might need to edit your BIOS
settings. Consult your computer manual on how to enter the BIOS
settings.

In the BIOS settings, try to apply the following changes one by one and
restart between each one of them. Some changes might not apply to your
computer model.

1. Edit the **Boot Order**. Depending on your computer model you should
see an entry for **removable drive** or **USB media**. Move this entry
to the top of the list to force your computer to attempt to start from
the first flash memory before starting from the internal hard disk. Save your
changes and restart.

1. Disable **Fast boot**.

1. If the computer is configured to start with **legacy BIOS**, try to
configure it to start with **UEFI**. Else, if the computer is configured
to start with **UEFI**, try to configure it to start with **legacy
BIOS**. To do so, try any of the following options if available:

   - Enable Legacy mode
   - Disable Secure boot
   - Enable CSM boot
   - Disable UEFI

1. Try to upgrade your BIOS version.

Troubleshooting: Tails does not start entirely
----------------------------------------------

The following section applies if the **Boot Tails** appears but not
*Tails Greeter* when starting Tails.

1. In the graphical boot menu, press `TAB`.

2. Remove the `quiet` option from the boot command line.

3. Add the `debug` and `nosplash` option.

4. Hopefully, this displays useful messages while starting Tails. You can
   [[send them to us by email|/support/talk]].

5. If the error message is `/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control
   turned off` followed by `(initramfs)`, then try removing the
   `live-media=removable` option.

   <div class="caution">

   <strong>When removing this option, if an adversary installed a fake
   Tails on an internal hard disk, then you will likely be starting
   this dangerous operating system instead of the genuine Tails that
   you intended to use.</strong>

   </div>

   If removing `live-media=removable` allows you to start Tails, please
   report a bug as documented above: this allows us to improve the [[list
   of problematic USB sticks|support/known_issues#problematic-usb-sticks]].
   In this case, you should install Tails on another, better supported
   USB stick.

Plug second flash memory
========================

1. After the Tails desktop appears, plug the second flash memory (USB stick or SD card) into the computer.

<div class="caution">

   [[!img desktop.png size=640x480 link=no]]

Use the encrypted persistent storage (optional)
===============================================

<div class="note">

If you don't want to store any data in Tails you can stop following
these instructions and start enjoying Tails right now.

</div>

You can create a *persistent volume* in the remaining free space on the
flash memory to store:

  - Your personal files and working documents
  - The software packages that you download and install in Tails
  - The configuration of the programs you use
  - Your encryption keys

The files in the persistent volume:

  - Remain available across separate working sessions.
  - Are encrypted using a passphrase of your choice.

Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not
each time you start Tails.

Warnings about persistence
--------------------------

<a id="sensitive_documents"></a>

### Storing sensitive documents

**The persistent volume is not hidden.** An attacker in possession of
the flash memory can know that there is a persistent volume on it. Take into consideration
that you can be forced or tricked to give out its passphrase.

<a id="overwriting_configurations"></a>

### Overwriting configurations

The programs included in Tails are carefully configured with security in
mind. If you use the persistence volume to overwrite the configuration
of the programs included in Tails, it can break this security or render
these programs unusable.

Furthermore, the anonymity of Tor and Tails relies on making it harder to
distinguish one Tails user from another. <strong>Changing the default
configurations can break your anonymity.</strong>

<a id="minimum"></a>

### Use to the minimum

**Use the persistent volume only when necessary and to the minimum.** It is
always possible to start Tails without activating the persistent volume. All the
features of the persistent volume are optional and need to be explicitly
activated. Only the files and folders that you specify are saved.

<a id="open_other_systems"></a>

### Opening the persistent volume from other operating systems

**It is possible to
open the persistent volume from other operating systems, but it might break
your security.**
Other operating systems should probably not be trusted to handle
sensitive information or leave no trace.

Create the encrypted persistent storage
---------------------------------------

To start the persistent volume assistant, choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent volume</span></span>.

The assistant proposes to create a new persistent volume on
the flash memory.

1. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase.
Specify a passphrase of your choice in both the
<span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> and <span class="guilabel">Verify
Passphrase</span> text boxes.

2. Click on the <span class="guilabel">Create</span> button.

3. Wait for the creation to finish.

<div class="bug">

<strong>If the creation is interrupted before it finishes</strong>, you may not
be able to start Tails from this flash memory any more. This can happen if you
close the window of the wizard or unplug the flash memory during the creation of
the persistent volume. [[Delete|first_steps/reset]] and
[[reinstall|first_steps/installation]] Tails to fix this issue.

</div>

The assistant shows a list of the possible persistence features. Each
feature corresponds to a set a files to be saved in the persistent
volume.

For the time being, we recommend you to only activate the **Personal
Data** persistence feature. You can modify the configuration of the
encrypted persistent storage later according to your needs.

Refer to our documentation [[configuring the encrypted persistent
storage|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]] to learn about about the
other options.

Enable the encrypted persistence storage
----------------------------------------

1. Shut down your computer and restart on the second flash memory.

1. In *Tails Greeter*, select your preferred language in the drop-down
list on the bottom left of the screen.

1. In the
<span class="guilabel">Use persistence?</span> dialog of [[Tails
Greeter|startup_options#tails_greeter]], choose <span class="guilabel">Yes</span> to
enable the persistent volume for the current working session.

2. Enter the passphrase of the persistent volume in the
<span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> text box.</span>

3. If you select the <span class="guilabel">Read-Only</span> check box, the
content of persistent volume will be available and you will be able to modify
it but the changes will not be saved.

1. Click **Login**.

You can now save your personal files and working documents in the
**Persistent** folder. To open the **Persistent** folder choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Places</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Persistent</span></span>.
