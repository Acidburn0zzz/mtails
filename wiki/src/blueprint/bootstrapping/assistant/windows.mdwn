Restart on first USB stick
==========================

Now that you have a Tails device, you can shutdown your computer and start using
Tails without altering your existing operating system.

Shutdown the computer, plug your device, and start the computer. You should see a
welcome screen prompting you to choose your language.

If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit the BIOS
settings. Restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key
to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of <span
class="keycap">F1</span>, <span class="keycap">F2</span>, <span
class="keycap">Del</span>, <span class="keycap">Esc</span> or
<span class="keycap">F10</span>. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings.
You need to edit the <span class="guilabel">Boot Order</span>.  Depending on your computer you should see an
entry for <span class="guilabel">removable drive</span> or <span class="guilabel">USB media</span>. Move this to the top of the list to
force the computer to attempt to start from your device before starting from the
internal hard disk. Save your changes and continue.

For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read [About.com:
How To Boot your Computer from a Bootable USB
Device](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm).

If you have problems accessing the BIOS, try to read [pendrivelinux.com: How to
Access BIOS](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/).

Problems starting Tails?
------------------------

Read our specific [[reporting guidelines when Tails does not
start|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/tails_does_not_start]].

Plug second USB stick
=====================

Install Tails on second USB stick
=================================

Tails includes <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>: a custom
installer for USB sticks and SD cards.

<div class="tip">

<p>Using <span class="application">Tails Installer</span> allows you to
later [[create a persistent volume|persistence]] in the free space
left on the device.</p>

</div>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="application">Tails Installer</span> can only install Tails on a
USB stick or SD card of <strong>at least 4 GB</strong>.</p>

</div>

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Tails Installer</span>
   </span>
   to start <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>.

1. To install onto a new device, click on the <span class="button">Clone &
   Install</span> button.

1. Plug the device onto which you want to install Tails.

   A new device, which corresponds to the USB stick or SD card, appears in the
   <span class="guilabel">Target Device</span> drop-down list.

1. Choose this new device from the <span class="guilabel">Target Device</span>
   drop-down list.

   <div class="caution">

   <ul>
   <li><strong>All the data on the installed device will be
   lost.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>This operation does not [[securely
   delete|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]] the lost data on the
   installed device.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>This operation does not copy the persistent volume of the
   device which is being cloned.</strong></li>
   </ul>

   </div>

1. To start the installation, click on the <span
   class="button">Install Tails</span> button.

1. Read the warning message in the pop-up window. Click on the <span
   class="button">Yes</span> button to confirm.

Restart on second USB stick
===========================

Configure persistence (optional)
================================

If you start Tails from a USB stick or SD card, you can create a
persistent volume in the free space left on the device by <span
class="application">Tails Installer</span>. The files in the persistent
volume are saved encrypted and remain available across separate working sessions.

<div class="note">

<p>It is only possible to create a persistent volume if the device, USB stick or
SD card, was installed using <span class="application">[[Tails
Installer|doc/first_steps/installation]]</span>.</p>

<p>This requires a USB stick or SD card of <strong>at least 4 GB</strong>.</p>

</div>

You can use this persistent volume to store different kinds of files:

  - your personal files and working documents
  - the software packages that you download and install in Tails
  - the configuration of the programs you use
  - your encryption keys

The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase.

Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not
each time you start Tails.
