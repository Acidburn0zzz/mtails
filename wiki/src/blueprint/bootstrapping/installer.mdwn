Vision
======

Installing Tails onto a USB stick is probably the most common and
recommended scenario when started with Tails as this allows incremental
upgrades and persistence.

But as of 2014, getting Tails installed on a USB stick requires having a
first temporary Tails to boot from and then running Tails Installer.
Also, due to the way Tails Installer partitions the USB stick, this
requires having two USB sticks and going through manual installation
steps, often using command line.

We want to eliminate the need for a first temporary Tails and have Tails
Installer available on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.

As part of the ISO verification process we also want to push more
verification logic to Tails Installer. See the [[blueprint on ISO
verification|verification]].

Tails Installer is also used to do full upgrades. We want to move this
to Tails Upgrader. See the [[blueprint on Tails Upgrader|upgrade]].

Future work
===========

Simplify the interface, remove the splash screen, and be more foolproof
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The current interface of *Tails Installer*, with its complicated splash screen,
pushes to much cognitive load to the user. For example, there is no point in
proposing to upgrade if there is no Tails installed on the USB stick. Instead,
building some more logic into the code itself would allow to ask the user only
for the decisions that makes sense for her to take and at the time when it
makes more sense for her to take them.

More concretely, we should progressively add to *Tails Installer* the
possibility to:

1. Autodetect if the destination key has Tails already, without making
   this visible to the user yet, but that's a prerequisite for the
   next steps.
2. Simplify the splash screen thanks to the autodetection code:
   - In Tails, merge "Install by cloning" and "Upgrade by cloning" into one single
   "Clone" button. And, depending on whether the destination device already
   has Tails installed or not, dynamically change the label of main 
   action button to "Install" or "Upgrade".
   (Note: this breaks the "re-installing Tails from scratch" use case, 
   but we document how to uninstall Tails, so that's
   no big deal). ([[!tails_ticket 9006]])
   - Outside Tails, remove the splash screen.
3. If the destination device already has Tails installed, add a second
   button below or side-by-side with the "Install" button with the label 
   "Upgrade". This allows again to choose whether to reinstall Tails
   from scratch or to upgrade the existing installation.
4. When using Tails Installer in Tails (as opposed to using Tails Installer
   from another OS), remove the splash screen and add a "Clone"
   button to the main interface. ([[!tails_ticket 8859]])

Other nice bonuses would be:

- Make it possible to "Upgrade from ISO" from
  the command line, for the [[Debian expert|install/expert/usb]] instructions. ([[!tails_ticket 8861]])
- Make it possible to "Install from ISO" from
  the command line, for the [[Debian expert|install/expert/usb]] instructions. ([[!tails_ticket 8861]]).
- Store version of Tails on destination key after install and upgrade. ([[!tails_ticket 8863]])
  - This would allow to display the installed version in "Target Device". ([[!tails_ticket 8862]])

Future
------

- Push more ISO verification logic to Tails Installer. See the
  [[blueprint on ISO verification|verification]].
