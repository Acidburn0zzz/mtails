[[!meta title="Tails Installer"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Installing Tails on a USB stick is the most common and the
recommended scenario for using Tails as it allows automatic upgrades and
persistence. DVDs are also getting less and less popular.

But as of 2016, installing Tails on a USB stick still:

  - Requires going through the command line sometimes, for example on macOS.
  - Requires going through an intermediary USB stick or DVD which is more
    complex, slower, and relies on third-party software (eg. UUI).

Future work
===========

We have plans to [[!tails_ticket 11679 desc="rethink the installation
process and upgrade process"]] in depth. This would take into account
the future work described in this section.

We want to eliminate the need for a first temporary Tails and have Tails
Installer available on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Do we really need a custom installer?
-------------------------------------

While working on porting Tails Installer to Debian and Ubuntu in 2015, we came
to question the future of *Tails Installer* in many ways. On the one hand, it's
a lot of work to maintain and port custom programs like *Tails Installer* and
we would be happy to lower this workload by relying on other installation
techniques or programs that would not be custom to Tails; on the other hand,
having a custom installer gives us much more control and possibilities in terms
of features proposed to the user and trust that we can put in a software that
we make and distribute ourselves.

What could we use instead of Tails Installer?

  - Other multiplatform USB installers

    - None of the usual suspects (YUMI, Unetbooting, Rufus, etc.) work on
      Linux, Windows, and macOS.
    - New tools for flashing disk images on SD cards for Raspberry Pies are
      appearing, like [[!tails_ticket 11348 desc="Etcher"]] but they are too
      green to be reliable.

  - Core utilities from other operating systems

    - GNOME Disks has a way to copy a disk image on a block device.
    - macOS supports only some formats. ([[!tails_ticket 8802]])
    - We couldn't found such utility for Windows. ([[!tails_ticket 8550]])

Porting Tails Installer to Windows and macOS
--------------------------------------------

Porting Tails Installer to Windows and macOS would provide a consistent and
simple way for installing Tails across all platforms and remove the need for an
intermediary USB stick or DVD. Still, this would require a massive amount of
work and skills that will be very hard to gather.

We started doing a feasibility study for:

  - [[Porting Tails Installer to Windows|blueprint/Port_Tails_Installer_to_Windows]].
  - [[Porting Tails Installer to macOS|blueprint/Port_Tails_Installer_to_OS_X]].

Other nice bonuses would be:

- If using the installer outside of Tails, point to the website to
  download the ISO. ([[!tails_ticket 8867]])
- Make it possible to "Upgrade from ISO" from
  the command line, for the [[Debian expert|install/expert/usb]] instructions. ([[!tails_ticket 8861]])
- Make it possible to "Install from ISO" from
  the command line, for the [[Debian expert|install/expert/usb]] instructions. ([[!tails_ticket 8861]]).
- Store version of Tails on destination key after install and upgrade. ([[!tails_ticket 8863]])
- This would allow to display the installed version in "Target Device". ([[!tails_ticket 8862]])

ISO verification
----------------

The capacities of our [[*Tails Verification* browser extension|contribute/design/verification_extension]]
are limited as can be seen in its
[[thread model|contribute/design/verification_extension#threat_model]].

A stronger solution might be to do the OpenPGP verification automatically from
Tails Installer. Users have to trust Tails Installer anyway (currently *on top
of* trusting the ISO image) and most modern operating systems have software
distribution mechanisms that are quite strong, hopefully stronger than plain
HTTPS (Debian's *APT*, Apple's *Mac App Store*, etc.).

  - Automating the OpenPGP verification would be easy to achieve on
    Linux but would require more research for other platforms.
  - Do we want Tails Installer to include the Tails signing key or to rather
    depend on external mechanisms to fetch and verify the signing key? Thinking
    about key transitionsâ€¦
  - Should we allow people to burn DVDs from Tails Installer as well? If Tails
    Installer becomes the recommended tool for verifying Tails, it makes
    sense to be able to burn DVDs from it.
  - We should still allow expert users to build more trust in our signing key through
    the OpenPGP WoT.

Endless full upgrades
---------------------

As of now, Tails Installer is also used to do full upgrades. We want to be able
to do this in Tails Upgrader instead.  See the [[blueprint on endless
upgrades|endless_upgrades]]. This might duplicate or conflict with some of the
work proposed to [[simplify the interface|installer#simplify]].

Future
------

- Push more ISO verification logic to Tails Installer. See the
  [[blueprint on ISO verification|verification]].
