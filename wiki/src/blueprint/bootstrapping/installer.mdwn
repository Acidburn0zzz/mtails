[[!meta title="Tails Installer"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Installing Tails on a USB stick is the most common and the
recommended scenario for using Tails it allows automatic upgrades and
persistence. DVDs are also getting less and less popular.

But as of 2016, installing Tails on a USB stick still:

  - Requires going through the command line sometimes, for example on Mac OS X.
  - Requires going through an intermediary USB stick or DVD which is more
    complex, slower, and relies on third-party software (eg. UUI).

We want to eliminate the need for a first temporary Tails and have Tails
Installer available on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.

As part of the ISO verification process we also want to push more
verification logic to Tails Installer. See the [[blueprint on ISO
verification|verification]].

Future work
===========

Simplify the interface, remove the splash screen, and be more foolproof
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The current interface of *Tails Installer*, with its complicated splash screen,
pushes to much cognitive load to the user. For example, there is no point in
proposing to upgrade if there is no Tails installed on the USB stick. Instead,
building some more logic into the code itself would allow to ask the user only
for the decisions that makes sense for her to take and at the time when it
makes more sense for her to take them.

More concretely, we should progressively add to *Tails Installer* the
possibility to:

1. Autodetect if the destination key has Tails already, without making
   this visible to the user yet, but that's a prerequisite for the
   next steps.
2. Simplify the splash screen thanks to the autodetection code:
   - In Tails, merge "Install by cloning" and "Upgrade by cloning" into one single
   "Clone" button. And, depending on whether the destination device already
   has Tails installed or not, dynamically change the label of main 
   action button to "Install" or "Upgrade".
   (Note: this breaks the "re-installing Tails from scratch" use case, 
   but we document how to uninstall Tails, so that's
   no big deal). ([[!tails_ticket 9006]])
   - Outside Tails, remove the splash screen.
3. If the destination device already has Tails installed, add a second
   button below or side-by-side with the "Install" button with the label 
   "Upgrade". This allows again to choose whether to reinstall Tails
   from scratch or to upgrade the existing installation.
4. When using Tails Installer in Tails (as opposed to using Tails Installer
   from another OS), remove the splash screen and add a "Clone"
   button to the main interface. ([[!tails_ticket 8859]])

Other nice bonuses would be:

- Make it possible to "Upgrade from ISO" from
  the command line, for the [[Debian expert|install/expert/usb]] instructions. ([[!tails_ticket 8861]])
- Make it possible to "Install from ISO" from
  the command line, for the [[Debian expert|install/expert/usb]] instructions. ([[!tails_ticket 8861]]).
- Store version of Tails on destination key after install and upgrade. ([[!tails_ticket 8863]])
  - This would allow to display the installed version in "Target Device". ([[!tails_ticket 8862]])

ISO verification
----------------

In 2015 we created a [[Download and Verify Extension|contribute/design/dave]]
for Firefox but its verification capacities are limited as can be seen in its
[[thread model|contribute/design/dave#index4h2]].

A stronger solution might be to do the OpenPGP verification automatically from
Tails Installer. Users have to trust Tails Installer anyway (currently *on top
of* trusting the ISO image) and most modern operating systems have software
distribution mechanisms that are quite strong, hopefully stronger than plain
HTTPS (Debian's *APT*, Apple's *Mac App Store*, etc.).

  - Automating the OpenPGP verification would be easy to achieve on
    Linux but would require more research for other platforms.
  - Do we want Tails Installer to include the Tails signing key or to rather
    depend on external mechanisms to fetch and verify the signing key? Thinking
    about key transitionsâ€¦
  - Should we allow people to burn DVDs from Tails Installer as well? If Tails
    Installer becomes the recommended tool for verifying Tails, people
    should be able to burn DVDs from it.
  - We should still allow expert users to build more trust in our signing key through
    the OpenPGP WoT.

Endless full upgrades
---------------------

As of now, Tails Installer is also used to do full upgrades. We want to be able
to do this in Tails Upgrader instead.  See the [[blueprint on endless
upgrades|endless_upgrades]]. This might duplicate or conflict with some of the
work proposed to [[simplify the interface|installer#simplify]].
