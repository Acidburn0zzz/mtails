[[!meta title="ISO verification"]]

We're currently considering more seriously the option of pushing more
verification logic into Tails Installer. It could then:

  - Automate OpenPGP verification. That would be easy to achieve on
    Linux and would need more research for other platforms. Note that
    having a super secure verification process on Windows might not be
    relevant.
  - Do download correlation of our signing key, and check it against the
    Debian keyring on Debian and derivatives.
  - Allow people to burn DVDs from Tails Installer as well. If Tails
    Installer becomes the recommended tool for verifying Tails, people
    should be able to burn DVDs from it.
  - Allow expert users to build more trust in our signing key through
    the OpenPGP WoT.

The advantages of going this way instead of pushing more verification
logic into the browser extension are that:

  - More people will be able to work on such code.
  - We will not rely on browsers for serious cryptography.
  - We will have less implementation restrictions than inside browser extensions.

The cons:

  - The verification using OpenPGP might be harder to port to Windows
    and OS X. But we are ready to provide lower standards of
    verification for them.
  - How would people verify Tails Installer on Windows and OS X? Maybe
    the browser extension could do that by then.
  - The browser extension will lose some of its relevance. It will
    still be useful until we get there, and maybe to verify Tails
    Installer.
