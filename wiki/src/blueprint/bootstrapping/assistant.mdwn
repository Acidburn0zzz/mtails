### First iteration

For the first iteration we did some parallel designs:

  - [wireframe by tchou](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/722/wireframe-tchou-20150323.pdf)

### Router, second iteration

We refined the first iteration still with parallel designs:

About JavaScript
================

During the monthly meeting of [[April
2014|contribute/meetings/201404#index3h1]] ([[!tails_ticket 7023]]) we
mentioned the idea of not having any JavaScript on our homepage, and by
extension, the fact that we should try to limit the amount of JavaScript
on our website in general. But this discussion was not fully concluded.
Here are a few elements to try to summarize our position, in particular
while working on the assistant:

Cons:

  - JavaScript can be dangerous for security and privacy. Tor Browser is
    supposed to block dangerous JavaScript and allow only the innocuous
    kind. But it's still better to be safe than sorry.
  - An important part of our audience want to be careful about
    JavaScript, for the reason mentioned above, and might disable it
    fully. To support this use case, we include the NoScript extension.
    So, to be coherent with this, every part of our website must be
    functional without JavaScript. This also ensures compatibility with
    all the levels of the security slider of Tor Browser ([[!tor_bug
    9387]]).
  - We don't know much about JavaScript ourselves, and even less about
    JavaScript security. So writing JavaScript seems complicated,
    costly, and error prone. Reusing JavaScript libraries like jQuery
    looks more feasible without taking much risks.

Pros:

  - We are already using JavaScript on our website (see the toggle on
    the old download page).
  - JavaScript might allow us to present better our information to the
    user and improve the quality of our website in terms of user
    experience. But using it to save us a bit of work or look cool might
    not be a good enough reason.

Conclusion:

  - We will use JavaScript to the minimum while ensure graceful
    degradation.

<a id="questions"></a>

Open problems
=============

  - Suggest human strategies for avoiding targeted malware:
    - Clone from a friend
    - Use a different computer than yours
    - Use Linux if available around you
  - Investigate how we could monitor the usage of the assistant: most
    common path, failures, people leaving, etc. But this can have
    privacy issues.
  - Integrate system requirements.
  - Integrate information about organization doing training.

Future work
===========

Mac compatibility list
----------------------

Mac users still face the most complicated situation, with no graphical
technique for USB and unpredictable hardware. This could be improved by
[[maintaining a list of Mac models and their compatibility with Tails
and our different installation techniques|assistant/mac]].

Better booting instructions
---------------------------

Booting is still a major pain point for people trying to start Tails for
the first time. Future work might involve:

  - Screencast to explain how to use the boot menu key [[!tails_ticket 10649]]
  - Better list of boot menu keys, like the [[Mac compatibility
    list|assistant/mac]].
  - Investigating whether it would be possible to tell the host
    operating system to restart on Tails directly.
