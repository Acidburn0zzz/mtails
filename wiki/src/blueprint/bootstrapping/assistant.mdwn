[[!meta title="Web assistant for getting started with Tails"]]

[[!toc]]

The web assistant will:

  - Merge download and install instructions into a single tool.
  - Integrate relevant parts of the documentation while preserving the
    documentation in its conventional format (for example for more
    advanced users or corner cases).
  - Integrate warnings.
  - Insist on the most frequent and recommended scenarios, and point to
    the documentation for corner cases or more advanced users (how to
    download using BitTorrent, how to start Tails as a VM, how to
    install using the Linux terminal, etc.)
  - Try to identify the OS of the user, and ask for confirmation.
  - Give an overview of the process before getting into it. So that
    people understand better what's going on, get an incentive to buy a
    DVD if they have a DVD drive, etc.

Open problems:

  - How to handle entry and exit points? What happen when someone in
    pointed to a documentation page for a corner case?
  - How to we deal with people leaving the assistant to restart their
    system? Do we want to propose them to print a page for the remaining
    steps?
  - How do we help better people with boot? Shall we want suggest the
    most likely keys based on the brand of the computer?
  - Decide when to ask questions about the scenario of the user: OS, DVD
    drive. Shall we ask them all at the beginning? Shall we ask them
    when needed?
  - How to explain the installation of tails-installer in Debian
    derivatives. Ubuntu has
    [AptURL](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptURL) in its Firefox.
  - How to make it easier to locate the ISO image once downloaded, for
    example to feed it into Tails Installer?
  - If we ask the user for its OS type, version, desired medium, does
    this have privacy implications? Do we want to do statistics on that?
  - Investigate how we could monitor the usage of the assistant: most
    common path, failures, people leaving, etc. But this can have
    privacy issues.
  - When people leave, do we want to give them some warning,
    explanation, good bye message?
  - Suggest human strategies for avoiding targeted malware:
    - Clone from a friend
    - Use a different computer than yours
    - Use Linux if available around you
  - Recommend people to open the website from their smartphone before
    restarting their computer.
  - Integrate system requirements.
  - Integrate information about organization doing training.
  - How do we connect all this with support, in case people are lost or
    having specific problems?

First iteration
===============

For the first iteration we did some parallel designs of a possible
wireframe for the web assistant:

  - [[wireframe by sajolida|1st_iteration/wireframe-sajolida-20150323.odg]]
  - [wireframe by tchou](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/722/wireframe-tchou-20150323.pdf)

Conclusion
----------

We decided to split the assistant into three phases:

  - The "[[router|assistant#router]]" which is the set of original
    questions that lead the user to choose an installation process.
  - The "[[overview|assistant#overview]]" which presents the
    installation process to the user, what is needed, how long it will
    take, what are the steps, etc.
  - The "steps" which are the detailed instructions for each step.

Router

Second iteration
----------------

We refined the first iteration still with parallel designs:

  - [[presentation by sajolida|router/2nd_iteration/router-sajolida-20150325.odp]]
  - [[presentation by tchou|router/2nd_iteration/router-tchou-20150325.odp]]

And conducted some user testing on both designs:

  - [[spreadsheet of summarized outcomings|router/2nd_iteration/router-testing-20150325.ods]]

Third iteration
---------------

### Objectives

  - Rework the alternative between USB and DVD:
    - Merge slide 11 & 13 from [[router/2nd_iteration/router-sajolida-20150325.odp]].
    - Make USB more preeminent major, and DVD less
  - Guide better Mac users:
    - Build a list of Mac hardware and their possible scenarios.
    - Explain where to find Mac hardware version.
    - Present clone (1/3) as an alternative to installation from scratch (2/3).
  - Add a welcoming screen.
  - Mention virtual machines as a minor option on OS page or destination media page.
  - Consider improving navigation.

Infography
----------

We brainstormed a bit more on the possible infography to explain the
installation steps graphically:
