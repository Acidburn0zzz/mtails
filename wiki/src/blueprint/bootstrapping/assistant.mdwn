### First iteration

For the first iteration we did some parallel designs:

  - [[wireframe by sajolida|1st_iteration/wireframe-sajolida-20150323.odg]]
  - [wireframe by tchou](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/722/wireframe-tchou-20150323.pdf)

### Router, second iteration

We refined the first iteration still with parallel designs:

  - [[presentation by tchou|router/2nd_iteration/router-tchou-20150325.odp]]
  - [[rainbow table of testing both proposal with the same people|router/2nd_iteration/router-testing-20150325.ods]]

### Router, third iteration

  - [[interactive LibreOffice prototype|router/3rd_iteration/router-3rd-iteration.fodp]]
  - [[wireframe|router/3rd_iteration/router-3rd-iteration.fodg]]
  - [[verbatim of user testing notes by sajolida|router_3rd_iteration_testing.txt]]
  - [[rainbow table of the results of the tests|router/3rd_iteration/router-3rd-iteration-testing.fods]]

Open problems
=============

  - Suggest human strategies to avoid targeted malware:
    - Clone from a friend
    - Use a different computer than yours
    - Use Linux if available around you
  - Investigate how we could monitor the usage of the assistant: most
    common path, failures, people leaving, etc. But this can have
    privacy issues.
  - Integrate system requirements.
  - Integrate information about organizations offering training.

Future work
===========

Mac compatibility list
----------------------

Mac users still face the most complicated situation, with no graphical
technique for USB and unpredictable hardware. This could be improved by
[[maintaining a list of Mac models and their compatibility with Tails
and our different installation techniques|assistant/mac]].

Better booting instructions
---------------------------

Booting is still a major pain point for people trying to start Tails for
the first time. Future work might involve:

  - Screencast to explain how to use the boot menu key. ([[!tails_ticket 10649]])
  - Better list of boot menu keys, like the [[Mac compatibility
    list|assistant/mac]].
  - Investigating whether it would be possible to tell the host
    operating system to restart on Tails directly.
    See for example: <http://www.askvg.com/tip-5-easy-ways-to-switch-from-windows-8-to-other-installed-os-in-dual-boot-environment/>

Integrate warnings
------------------

Our [[warning page|doc/about/warning]] is good but it's also one of the
oldest page in our documentation and it would deserve a bit of work
([[!tails_ticket 8845]]). Furthermore, it would make a lot of sense to
integrate it in the assistant, to teach people about Tails as they are
installing it. An idea would be to display our warnings while the ISO
image is downloaded through [[DAVE|contribute/design]] ([[!tails_ticket 9386]]).
