[[!meta title="Bootstrapping workflow"]]

This blueprint analyses and proposes simplifications to the workflow of
a new user discovering Tails until she gets a full-featured Tails USB
stick with persistence.

Big logical steps are:

  - Learn what Tails is
  - Download the ISO
  - Verify the ISO
  - Install medium (might require going through an intermediary Tails)
  - Create persistence

2014
====

In 2014 the different steps in this process were scattered all around our
website and users had to fight their way through it:

2015
====

In 2015 we worked on several improvements to simplify greatly this
workflow:

  - Tails Installer in [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/tails-installer) and [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~tails-team/+archive/ubuntu/tails-installer)
  - *Download and Verify Extension* for Firefox now replaced by the
    *Tails Verification* browser extension. ([[Design document|contribute/design/verification_extension]])
  - Installation Assistant to guide the user throughout this process. ([[Blueprint|assistant]])

2017
====

In 2017 we worked on:

  - Simplified *Tails Installer* by [[removing the splash screen|news/version_3.2]].
  - Porting *Download and Verify Extension* to Web Extensions for Firefox 57 which implied:
    - Creating *Tails Verification*, its successor.
      *Tails Verification* works on Firefox and Chrome but cannot embeded or
      monitor the download of the ISO image anymore.
      ([[Design document|contribute/design/verification_extension]])
    - Redesigning the download page as a consequence.

Future work
===========

Graphical installer for Mac
---------------------------

In 2015 we couldn't find a graphical way of creating an intermediary Tails on
USB stick from Mac ([[!tails_ticket 8802]]) and people have to go through the
command line. Finding this would be game changer for Mac users.

Lead people from one big step to the next through software
----------------------------------------------------------

We could:

  - Add splash screen about *Tails Installer* when starting on an intermediary Tails USB stick. ([[!tails_ticket 8836]])
  - Add splash screen about persistence when starting for the first time on a final Tails USB stick.
