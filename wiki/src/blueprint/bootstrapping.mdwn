[[!meta title="Bootstrapping workflow"]]

This blueprint analyses and proposes simplifications to the workflow of
a new user discovering Tails until she gets a full-featured Tails USB
stick with persistence.

Big logical steps are:

  - Learn what Tails is
  - Download the ISO
  - Verify the ISO
  - Install medium (might require going through a intermediary Tails)
  - Create persistence

different area of that process:

2015

In 2015 we worked on several improvements to simplify greatly this
workflow:

  - Tails Installer in [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/tails-installer) and [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~tails-team/+archive/ubuntu/tails-installer)
  - [[Download and Verify Extension|contribute/design/dave]] for Firefox
  - [[Installation Assistant|assistant]] to guide the user throughout this process

Future work

Lead people from one big step to the next through software
----------------------------------------------------------

We could:

  - Add splash about *Tails Installer* when starting on intermediary Tails USB stick. ([[!tails_ticket #8838]])
  - Add splash about persistence when starting for the first time on final Tails USB stick.
