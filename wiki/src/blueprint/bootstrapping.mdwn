[[!meta title="Bootstrapping workflow"]]

This blueprint analyses and proposes simplifications to the workflow of
a new user discovering Tails until she gets a full-featured Tails USB
stick with persistence.

Big logical steps are:

  - Learn what Tails is
  - Download the ISO
  - Verify the ISO
  - Install medium (might require going through a bootstrapping medium)
  - Create persistence

Subpages

Check the following subpages to see the improvements that we proposed in
different area of that process:

  - [[ISO verification|verification]]
  - [[Browser extension|extension]]
  - [[Tails Installer|installer]]
  - [[Booting|booting]]
  - [[Upgrades|upgrade]]

2015
====

Over 2015 we will work on several improvements to simplify greatly this
workflow:

  - Tails Installer in Debian
  - [[Browser extensions|extension]] for automatic verification of the ISO
  - [[Web assistant|assistant]] to guide the user throughout this process

Involved tools

[[!img tools.png link=tools.fodg]]

Notes:

- **Debian Hacker** corresponds to a path on the command line only. Its
  main benefit is to go through the **Debian keyring** verification
  which is the strongest verification technique that we propose.
- **Debian** is a path for Debian derivatives where Tails Installer is
  available. That will be the case of Ubuntu starting from 15.10,
  Debian Jessie backports, and Debian Stretch ([[!tails_ticket 8805]]).
- **Other OS** is Windows, Mac OS X, Fedora, etc.
- **OpenPGP with Debian keyring** are command line instructions for verifying the
  Tails signing key against the Debian keyring.
- **Extension from Debian** takes for granted that the ISO verification
  extension will be available in Debian ([[!tails_ticket 8822]]). This
  might not be the case and then people would fallback on **Extension
  from browser**.
- **GNOME Disks** now has a "Restore Disk Image" feature which can be
  used to copy an ISO image onto a USB stick and is widely available.
- **UUI** has been our canonical installer on Windows for years.
- **DiskUtils** should be tested on Mac, unfortunately it doesn't work
  for us ([[!tails_ticket 8802]]).

Bonus for 2015
--------------

- Add splash when booting manual installation from USB [[!tails_ticket #8838]].
