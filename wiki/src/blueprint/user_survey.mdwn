Questions from the Foundations Team
===================================

OpenPGP support outside of Thunderbird ([[!tails_ticket 8310]], [[!tails_ticket 17183]], [[!tails_ticket 17169]])
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will become an even hotter topic once Enigmail goes away in a few months:
Thunderbird will maintain its own keyring, independently from GnuPG's ⇒
Seahorse will stop being useful for anything related to email, so the
cost/benefit of vaguely supporting it will become even higher.

### Notes

- Secure Drop mentions encrypting files with GPG went sending submissions:

I2P (#12264)
------------

It's unclear what we should tell nowadays to folks interested in re-adding I2P
support.

Research questions
==================

- Size of user base

  - How many users do we really have?
  - Right now we only have number of boots per day but combining this
    with how frequently people use Tails, we could extrapolate rough
    number of users and maybe usage categories (fraction of frequent
    users and occasional users, etc.).

- Technical skills

  - How technically skilled are our users?
  - How big is the difference between the technical skills of our target
    audience and real audience?
  - Is there a match between how hard Tails is to use and the skills of
    our actual users?

- Region

  - Is Tails useful and accessible by a global audience?
  - Information on where Tails is used the most is very helpful for
    fundraising, outreach, or translation efforts.

- Current features

  - What are people using Tails the most?
    This would help us clarify what are the most important features of
    Tails and prioritize incremental improvements.

- New features

  - How shall we prioritize our future plans?
  - What is missing the most in Tails?
    This would help us build a better roadmap.
