[[!meta title="Translation platform"]]

Our (website) translation infrastructure has a pretty high barrier for
new translators, especially those who are not familiar with Git and/or
the command line.
Furthermore, the current process makes it hard to add new languages, as often a team cannot be built easily over a long period of time and a web interface could nevertheless help keep translations until a new person arrives.
