[[!meta title="About possible derivatives"]]

What for:

- Include additional features that we are not ready to add to Tails (for example
  to include GNUnet or Namecoin).
- Have custom branding or configuration.
- Provide ISO images with less or different features (for example to
  have VPN instead of Tor).

Why is it complicated:

- Release every 6 weeks
- Heavy quality assurance process (automated builds and tests)
- Infrastructure (upgrades)
- User trust (authenticated downloads, OpenPGP Web-of-Trust)

Good ways of doing it:

- Don't build your own ISO images.
- Package your specific applications in Debian to make them easier to
  use in Tails.
- Document how to use your specific applications in Tails.
- Rely on the mechanisms already available in Tails to adapt it to your
  needs (additional software packages, persistent storage).
- Help us build in Tails other mechanisms that you might need to adapt
  it to your needs (persistence of DConf settings, APT sources, etc.).
- Talk with us to see how we can adapt our ISO images to make them
  easier for your to reuse.
