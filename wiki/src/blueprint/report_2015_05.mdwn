[[!meta title="Tails report for May, 2015"]]

This month, despite all the blossoming flowers (at least in the northern hemisphere), we still worked on our computers to release 1.4 :)

Let's use this report to mention that we provide [[many support options|support]] (public mail, encrypted mail, irc) but we don't do user support on Twitter. We also saw that there is an active subReddit dedicated to Tails, but we don't follow it and the answers provided there might be wrong.

That said, we're really happy to see the growing community around Tails!

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.4 was released on May 12, 2015|news/version_1.4]] (major release).

* The next release (1.4.1) is [[planned for June 30|https://tails.boum.org/contribute/calendar/]].

Code
====

* We sent our changes to Tor Launcher upstream.

* We changed the default search engine in the Tor Browser to Disconnect, because startpage was sometimes asking users to fill a captcha.

* We fixed Tails Upgrader so that it is now localized to each language supported in Tails :)

* We removed mutt and msmtp, that don't really fulfill Tails design goal. If you used them, you can [[install them|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software]] and save them in persistence.

* We installed cdrdao to enable byte-to-byte disc copy in Brasero.

* The complete list of changes is in each release's changelog.

* FIXME: initial steps to evaluate Tails on touchscreen devices

Documentation and Website
=========================

* We added a [[link to Riseup documentation about Claws Mail configuration|doc/anonymous_internet/claws_mail]], since it's a common question.

* We documented the new [[security slider in Tor Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#security_slider]].

* We made clearer in Tor Browser documentation that you have to activate persistence to [[download files larger than the available RAM|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#confinement]].

* The [[workaround when the language layout is not applied|support/known_issues#keyboard_layout]] is now explained.

* We added to [[our "features" page|doc/about/features]] the version of Debian we're based on and the languages that Tails supports.

* We completed [[the page with our OpenPGP keys|doc/about/openpgp_keys]] that had not been updated after the creation of many new mailing lists.

* We updated the [[automatic upgrade page|doc/first_steps/upgrade]] to explain the process when upgrading more than one version, and gave the command-line to start the upgrader manually if you had no network at startup.

* We added a note in the [[persistence configuration page|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]] to list the things that users ask often but are not implemented yet.

User Experience
===============

FIXME

Infrastructure
==============

* We improved the test suite to make it a lot more robust.

Upcoming events
---------------

* People are organizing [[a workshop about Tails|http://www.lacantine-brest.net/event/atelier-datalove-tails-x-tor/]] in Brest, France, in June.
