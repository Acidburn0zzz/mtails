[[!meta title="Tails report for May, 2015"]]

This month, despite all the blossoming flowers (at least in the northern hemisphere), we still worked on our computers to release 1.4 :)

Let's use this report to mention that we provide [[many user support options|support]] (public email, encrypted mail, IRC) but we don't do user support on Twitter. We also saw that there is an active subReddit dedicated to Tails, but we don't follow it and the answers provided there might be wrong.

That said, we're really happy to see the growing community around Tails!

[[!toc]]

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.4 was released on May 12, 2015|news/version_1.4]] (major release).

* The next release (1.4.1) is [[planned for June 30|https://tails.boum.org/contribute/calendar/]].

Code
====

* We sent our changes to Tor Launcher upstream.

* We followed Tor Browser on their change to Disconnect as default search engine, because StartPage was sometimes asking users to fill captchas.

* We fixed Tails Upgrader so that it is now localized to each language supported in Tails :)

* We removed mutt and msmtp, that don't really fulfill Tails design goal. If you used them, you can [[install them|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software]] and save them in persistence.

* We installed cdrdao to enable byte-to-byte disc copy in Brasero.

* The complete list of changes is in each release's changelog.

* FIXME: initial steps to evaluate Tails on touchscreen devices

Documentation and website
=========================

* We published a security advisory about [[Claws Mail leaking plaintext of encrypted emails to IMAP server|security/claws_mail_leaks_plaintext_to_imap]] and documented workarounds.

* We added a [[link to Riseup documentation about Claws Mail configuration|doc/anonymous_internet/claws_mail]], since it's a common question.

* We documented the new [[security slider in Tor Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#security_slider]].

* We made clearer in Tor Browser documentation that you have to activate persistence to [[download files larger than the available RAM|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#confinement]].

* The [[workaround when the language layout is not applied|support/known_issues#keyboard_layout]] is now explained.

* We added to [[our "features" page|doc/about/features]] the version of Debian we're based on and the languages that Tails supports.

* We completed [[the page with our OpenPGP keys|doc/about/openpgp_keys]] that had not been updated after the creation of many new mailing lists.

* We updated the [[automatic upgrade page|doc/first_steps/upgrade]] to explain the process when upgrading more than one version, and gave the command-line to start the upgrader manually if you had no network at startup.

* We added a note in the [[persistence configuration page|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]] to list the things that users ask often but are not implemented yet.

User experience
===============

- On the [[Download and Verify Tails|blueprint/bootstrapping/extension]] browser extension:
  - We wrote a [[draft HTML code|blueprint/bootstrapping/extension/prototype]]
    to start the work of Giogio Maone on the code.

- On the [[Installation Assistant|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]]:
  - We analysed the results of the user testing on the 3rd iteration of
    the router. See subtasks of [[!tails_ticket 9445]].
  - We drafted a new wireframe for the [overview of the installation
    scenario](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/782/overview-20150521-tchou.pdf).
  - We worked together with [wedodata](www.wedodata.fr) to improve the [infography
    describing the installation
    steps](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/792/infography-20150527.svg).
  - We started working on a [[!tails_gitweb_branch web/assistant desc="ikiwiki
    prototype" of the Installation Assistant.

Infrastructure
==============

* We improved the test suite to make it a lot more robust.

* We wrote new tests for Electrum, the "Report an error" launcher, etc.

* Our test suite covers FIXME scenarios, FIXME more that in April.

* FIXME more?

Funding
=======

* We published our [[income statement for 2014|doc/about/finances#index1h1]].

FIXME

Outreach
========

* A talk about Tails took place at a [[MiniDebConf in Bucharest, Romania|http://bucharest2015.mini.debconf.org/]] May 16th ([[slides|contribute/how/promote/material/slides/MiniDebConf-Bucarest-20150516/MiniDCtalk/]]).

Upcoming events
---------------

* Les Chats Cosmiques is organizing [[a workshop about Tails and Tor|http://www.lacantine-brest.net/event/atelier-datalove-tails-x-tor/]] at La Cantine Brestoise in Brest, France on June 18.

* Please let us know if you organize an event about Tails, we'll be glad to announce it :)

FIXME more ?

On-going discussions
====================

FIXME

Press and testimonials
======================

* Many online newspapers covered the 1.4 release, see our [[press]] page.

Translation
===========

* We're planning to change our translation platform, if you're knowledgeable about one or if you want to help testing some, please see the [[!tails_ticket 9049]] and [[blueprint|blueprint/translation_platform]]!

Metrics
=======

* Tails has been started more than FIXME times this month. This makes FIXME boots a day on average.

* FIXME downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO from our website.

* FIXME bug reports were received through WhisperBack.
