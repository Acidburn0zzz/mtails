Documentation and Website
=========================

* We added a [[link to Riseup documentation about Claws Mail configuration|doc/anonymous_internet/claws_mail]], since it's a common question.

* We documented the new [[security slider in Tor Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#security_slider]].

* We made clearer in Tor Browser documentation that you have to activate persistence to [[download files larger than the available RAM|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#confinement]].

* The [[workaround when the language layout is not applied|support/known_issues#keyboard_layout]] is now explained.

* We added to [[our "features" page|doc/about/features]] the version of Debian we're based on and the languages that Tails supports.

* We completed [[the page with our OpenPGP keys|doc/about/openpgp_keys]] that had not been updated after the creation of many new mailing lists.

* We updated the [[automatic upgrade page|doc/first_steps/upgrade]] to explain the process when upgrading more than one version, and gave the command-line to start the upgrader manually if you had no network at startup.

* We added a note in the [[persistence configuration page|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]] to list the things that users ask often but are not implemented yet.
