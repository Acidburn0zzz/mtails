# Scope

The idea is to avoid blocking the release process and normal Tails
usage if lizard goes down. It's *not* meant to replace lizard for more
than a few weeks.

# Services

Years ago we decided we needed a failover for:

- APT repository
- Whisperback relay
- rsync server
- Gitolite service

XXX: update this list

# System requirements

This is about [[!tails_ticket 10243]].

Two years ago we wrote:

* 20GB of disk space, and growing (will jump to a few dozens GB once
  we distribute source packages ([[!tails_ticket 5987]]) and get
  ourselves a freezable APT repo ([[!tails_ticket 5926]])).
* low CPU usage
* 1GB of RAM should be enough
* datacenter-class bandwidth
