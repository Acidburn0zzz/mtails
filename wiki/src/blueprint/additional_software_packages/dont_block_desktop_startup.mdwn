[[!meta title="Better manage installation and update of additional software packages"]]

Speed up installation
=====================

To solve [[!tails_ticket 9059 desc="#9059"]], which can currently block
the opening of the desktop for several minutes, we should investigate:

  - Starting reading packages lists and building cache on GDM PostLogin.
    For that we need an APT mechanism to do all this without installing
    or removing anything.

  - Installing packages once the session has started.

  - Using `nice` to not slow down the desktop too much in competition with
    `tails-upgrade-frontend`.

  - What kind of packages would suffer from being installed after the
    session started.

  - A notification mechanism for APT to be started after the session is
    ready.
