I think that we should do, in this rough order:

### Skip any in-person usability tests for now

It's quite time consuming and the Covid situation makes it more
complicated. We can do other things and keep this for next year.

Week 32
-------

### Brainstorm on images with Andrés

Week 33
-------

### Survey lapsed donors

Goals:

* Learn about motivation to better frame our message
* Identify low hanging fruits in how we could steward them better

Subject: Tell us how you feel about your donation to Tails

Hi,

Thank you so much for donating to Tails in the past!

Donations from individuals like you are our most precious source of
income as they guarantee our independence.

Today, we want to ask you a few questions about how satisfied you are
with your donation and Tails in general.

We will use your feedback to improve our relationship with donors like
you and encourage more people to donate to Tails. This will help us
continue building the world's most popular secure operating system.

To help us, please answer this survey of 7 simple questions before
Thursday, August 20:

Your opinion matters to us!

Our achievements in 2020 so far
-------------------------------

* In 2020, Tails was started 30 000 times every day on average, 18% more
  than in 2019.

* We completely redesigned our Home and About pages, making it more
  engaging and easier to understand what Tails is and why people should
  use it:

  https://tails.boum.org/
  https://tails.boum.org/about/

* We added support to Secure Boot, now required by most modern laptops.

* We improved automatic upgrades to remove the need for most manual
  upgrades, which was one of the major pain points for users.

* We simplified the instructions on how to start Tails, which was
  another major pain point for users.

* We created and printed outreach material in 5 languages to tell
  the world about Tails:

  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/promote/material/leaflets/

* We migrated our issue tracker to GitLab to make it easier to
  contribute to Tails and speed up our work.

In solidarity,

Week 34
-------

### Add an image to /donate

And work on how to put the image on the page.

At some point we should show the draft images to people. This should
be easy to do remotely with a handful of past donors that we know a
bit better and can ask a favor to. We could also skip this testing
step and fallback on A/B testing during the campaign.

### Give some love to /donate/thanks and /donate/canceled

These pages look crap and we don't spend time on them because we don't
see them ourselves. But I think that they are critical and low-hanging
fruits. Some [psychological
foundations](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/peak-end-rule/) for that.

Add to each of them:

* A feedback mechanism, especially on /donate/canceled!
* An image
* Better text

These are things that are better studied in usability tests but they
are so bad right now that it should be easy to agree on possible
improvements while keeping them cheap.

Weeks 35-38
-----------

### Do non-controversial changes on /donate

Since we won't do usability tests and to avoid a situation à la
[[!tails_ticket 16830]], we will limit our changes to:

* Things we agree on easily
* Research-based recommendations from experts
* Things we can A/B test during the campaign

Ideas:

* Add an image.
* Improve "How we spend our money" to tell more about the impact.
* Improve the headline.

### Plan some A/B testing during the campaign (if needed)

Like I did for [[!tails_ticket 16830]], we could do more such things
during the campaign. For example, we could test different images, text,
or controversial changes.

Weeks 42
--------

### Analyze the results of the A/B testing on frequency buttons ([[!tails_ticket 16830]])

Compare the conversion rates between Tor Browser, Tails, and mobile.
I'll be analyzing logs when looking at the results of the A/B testing on
the monthly buttons anyway.

Anything else worth analyzing in the logs?
