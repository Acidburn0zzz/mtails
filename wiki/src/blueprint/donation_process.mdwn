I think that we should do, in this rough order:

Week 31
-------

### Skip any in-person usability tests for now

It's quite time consuming and the Covid situation makes it more
complicated. We can do other things and keep this for next year.

Week 32
-------

### Brainstorm on images with Andrés

Week 33
-------

<h3 id="survey">Survey lapsed donors</h3>

Goals:

* Learn about motivation to better frame our message
* Identify low hanging fruits in how we could steward them better

Subject: Tell us how you feel about your donation to Tails

Hi,

Thank you so much for donating to Tails in the past!

Donations from individuals like you are our most precious source of
income as they guarantee our independence.

Today, we want to ask you a few questions about how satisfied you are
with your donation and Tails in general.

We will use your feedback to improve our relationship with donors like
you and encourage more people to donate to Tails. This will help us
continue building the world's most popular secure operating system.

To help us, please answer this survey of 7 simple questions before
Thursday, August 20:

{SURVEYURL}

Your opinion matters to us!

Our achievements in 2020 so far
-------------------------------

* In 2020, Tails was started 30 000 times every day on average, 18% more
  than in 2019.

* We completely redesigned our Home and About pages, making it more
  engaging and easier to understand what Tails is and why people should
  use it:

  https://tails.boum.org/
  https://tails.boum.org/about/

* We added support to Secure Boot, now required by most modern laptops.

* We improved automatic upgrades to remove the need for most manual
  upgrades, which was one of the major pain points for users.

* We simplified the instructions on how to start Tails, which was
  another major pain point for users.

* We created and printed outreach material in 5 languages to tell
  the world about Tails:

  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/promote/material/leaflets/

* We migrated our issue tracker to GitLab to make it easier to
  contribute to Tails and speed up our work.

In solidarity,

   1. **What problem did you have while donating?** (Short text)

1. **Do you have any questions, concerns, or possible improvements for us to take into account?** (Open ended)

   - How we calculate the number of users (1)
   - Rude answer from Help Desk (1)
   - T-shirts (1)
   - A few technical suggestions
   - Lots of love!

Conclusions:

- We're doing good! Negative comments were few exceptions in a mass of love:
  the work that we do is very important and we do it well.

- We should communicate a bit more and better with past donors:

  * The main reason for lapsed donors not to renew their donation is lack of
    awareness.

  * We should write a newsletter to donors half-way through the year or when we
    have major improvements. ([[!tails_ticket fundraising#17703]])

  * Adding an opt-in mechanism for our newsletter would allow us to be less shy
    to write them. ([[!tails_ticket fundraising#17702]])

  * LimeSurvey is more convenient to send mass emails to donors.
    ([[!tails_ticket fundraising#17704]])

  * We should communicate more about the impact of donations and how we spend
    the money.

- About our donors and their interests:

  * Donors are mostly users (74%) but they also want to help others (70%).

  * Donors mostly talk about:

    - Privacy (24)
    - Protection from oppressive governments and persecution (18)
    - Liberty and freedom of speech (16)

Week 34
-------

### Add an image to /donate

And work on how to put the image on the page.

At some point we should show the draft images to people. This should
be easy to do remotely with a handful of past donors that we know a
bit better and can ask a favor to. We could also skip this testing
step and fallback on A/B testing during the campaign.

### Give some love to /donate/thanks and /donate/canceled

These pages look crap and we don't spend time on them because we don't
see them ourselves. But I think that they are critical and low-hanging
fruits. Some [psychological
foundations](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/peak-end-rule/) for that.

Add to each of them:

* A feedback mechanism, especially on /donate/canceled!
* An image
* Better text

These are things that are better studied in usability tests but they
are so bad right now that it should be easy to agree on possible
improvements while keeping them cheap.

Weeks 35-38
-----------

### Do non-controversial changes on /donate

Since we won't do usability tests and to avoid a situation à la
[[!tails_ticket 16830]], we will limit our changes to:

* Things we agree on easily
* Research-based recommendations from experts
* Things we can A/B test during the campaign

Ideas:

* Add an image.
* Improve "How we spend our money" to tell more about the impact.
* Improve the headline.

### Plan some A/B testing during the campaign (if needed)

Like I did for [[!tails_ticket 16830]], we could do more such things
during the campaign. For example, we could test different images, text,
or controversial changes.

Weeks 42
--------

### Analyze the results of the A/B testing on frequency buttons ([[!tails_ticket 16830]])

Compare the conversion rates between Tor Browser, Tails, and mobile.
I'll be analyzing logs when looking at the results of the A/B testing on
the monthly buttons anyway.

Anything else worth analyzing in the logs?
