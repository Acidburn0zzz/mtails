[[!meta title="Donation campaign for 2016"]]

We are preparing here possible blog posts for the [[!tails_ticket 9855
desc="donation campaign of 2016"]].

Here are the ideas we had were we initially drafted the plan. The
splitting and structure of the different posts is unclear but we should
cover more or less:

1. Launching and explaining the campaign
   - Explain our budget and what we use the money for
   - Explain why donations are important to remain independent
   - Explain again why Tails comes for free
1. Recap all the great things we did since the last donation campaign
1. Reuse the old post about who you are helping when donating to Tails
1. Explain our roadmap
1. Thank you!

Regarding the writing style, I would stay we should be:

  - Short but not too much. Something you can read in 2 minutes, some
    300 words, etc.

  - Make people understand better our work, how we function, and why we
    need this money (instead of asking for it for charity). This implies
    being informative and backing up our words with facts and figures
    (budget, past achievements, etc.)

  - Cross-reference previous blog posts in the campaign.

  - Try to be visual (graphics, screenshots, photos, etc.).

  - Maybe include template for tweets.

Why we need donations
=====================

Unlike most other tools on the Internet, Tails comes for *free* as in
*freedom*. We are not selling your data, sending you targeted advertising, or
will ever sell our project to a big company. We give out Tails for free because
we believe that the Internet would be a better place without surveillance and
censorship. But also because being free software is a necessary requirement for
our tools to be safe, and protect you as intended. If our source code was
closed, their would be no way of actually verifying that our software is
trustworthy.

So even if we wanted to, we could not sell Tails. And that's amazing.

[[Since 2014|doc/about/finances]], we raised 210'000€ on average each year, coming from:

  - People like you
  - Private companies like Mozilla or DuckDuckGo
  - Foundations and NGOs like Hivos and Access Now
  - Entities related to the US government like the Open Technology Fund (OTF)
    or the National Democratic Institute (NDI)

[[!img income.png link="no" class="margin center" alt="Related to US government: 34%, Foundations & NGOs: 34%, Individuals: 17%, Companies: 15%"]]

We often hear complains about the fact that many
software projects that are meant to fight surveillance, like Tor and
Tails, get a lot of funding from the US government whose own surveillance
projects are severely criticized. We completely share this concern and
we will worry about our accountability and sustainability as long as the
survival of our project depends on a few small grants, some of them coming from
organizations linked to governments.

Now, we would like you to think about it: where should our funding come from?

The answer is clear for us: the survival of Tails should be guaranteed by our
users themselves, so that in return, we can continue to use our money in their
best interest, with complete independence.

From anonymized statistics on our website we know that around 17'000 people use
Tails every day. If each of them donated 12€, the price of a USB stick, our
budget for the whole year would be raised in a single day. As you can see, this
is a realistic goal and a ridiculous budget compared to the multibillionaire
companies and agencies running the surveillance business.

But many of our users could actually get in
trouble if they donated to an anti-surveillance tool like Tails. So when donating to Tails
you are also [[helping all of these people|news/who_are_you_helping]] by keeping Tails alive. Please
consider setting up a yearly or monthly donation.
 
What we do with your money
==========================

In 2015, we spent around 184'000€, distributed as follow:

[[!img expenses.png link="no" class="margin center" alt="Releases &
foundations: 18%, New features: 16%, Help desk: 16%, Administration
work: 9%, Administration others: 4%, Meeting: 10%, Infrastructure
others: 1%, Infrastructure work: 27%"]]

- Even without building anything new in Tails, publishing our
  **releases** every 6 weeks is a lot of work as it also implies fixing
  the problems found in previous versions, documenting the changes,
  migrating to newer versions of Debian, GNOME, and Tor Browser, and
  making sure that the **foundations** of Tails stay relevant. As the
  schedule of emergency releases is unpredictable, they are hard to fund
  through grants and we instead usually rely on donations.

- In proportion, **new features** constitute a rather small part of our
  budget. They are almost exclusively covered by grants or developed by
  volunteers. Since 2015, new feature that were not funded by grants
  included:

  - Integrating the *Electrum* Bitcoin client.
  - Replacing *Vidalia* with *Onion Circuits*.
  - Continue working on a new version of *Tails Greeter*.
  - Mentoring a Google Summer of Code on *Tails Server* to allow running
    onion services from Tails (websites, collaboration tools, etc.).
  - Adding an offline mode that disables all networking.
  - Adding support for `obfs4` Tor bridges.
  - Writing numerous additions to our website and online documentation.

- Our **help desk** is helping hundreds of Tails users each month. Each
  user request costs us 6€ on average to proceed. In 2016 our help desk
  was paid entirely from donations.

- Organizing our own **meetings** and attending conferences in our field
  is critical to keep our community alive and relevant. But this is
  usually hard to get funded by grants, so donations help us a lot here.
  Since 2015, we attended more than 15 international conferences on free
  software (DebConf), Internet freedom (IFF), hacking (32C3), human
  rights (RightsCon), and journalism (Logan CIJ). And organised more
  than 10 internal in-person meetings.

- In 2015, we worked a lot on **infrastructure**, for example to write
  an automated test suite to verify continuously the well-functioning of
  our ISO images, to automate the build of development ISO images for
  testing, etc. This work is invisible to the user but, for example,
  makes it much faster to publish emergency releases when we discover
  serious bugs.

- Keeping Tails successful also implies quite a bit of
  **administration** to raise funds, do accounting, organize work, write
  reports, etc.

- Since 2015, we added Farsi and Italian translations on our website and
  worked on the prototype of a translation platform based on *Weblate*
  to allow more translators to contribute and more diverse people to use
  Tails.

Our goals for the coming years
==============================

We will use it to do [[all this|/blueprint/roadmap/]].
