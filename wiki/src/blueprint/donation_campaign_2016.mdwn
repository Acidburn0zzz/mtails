[[!meta title="Donation campaign for 2016"]]

We are preparing here possible blog posts for the [[!tails_ticket 9855
desc="donation campaign of 2016"]].

Here are the ideas we had were we initially drafted the plan. The
splitting and structure of the different posts is unclear but we should
cover more or less:

1. Launching and explaining the campaign
   - Explain our budget and what we use the money for
   - Explain why donations are important to remain independent
   - Explain again why Tails comes for free
1. Recap all the great things we did since the last donation campaign
1. Reuse the old post about who you are helping when donating to Tails
1. Explain our roadmap
1. Thank you!

Regarding the writing style, I would stay we should be:

  - Short but not too much. Something you can read in 2 minutes, some
    300 words, etc.

  - Make people understand better our work, how we function, and why we
    need this money (instead of asking for it for charity). This implies
    being informative and backing up our words with facts and figures
    (budget, past achievements, etc.)

  - Cross-reference previous blog posts in the campaign.

  - Try to be visual (graphics, screenshots, photos, etc.).

  - Maybe include template for tweets.

Why we need donations
=====================

Unlike most other tools on the Internet, Tails comes for *free* as in
*freedom*. We are not selling your data, sending you targeted advertising, or
will ever sell our project to a big company. We give out Tails for free because
we believe that the Internet would be a better place without surveillance and
censorship. But also because being free software is a necessary requirement for
our tools to be safe, and protect you as intended. If our source code was
closed, their would be no way of actually verifying that our software is
trustworthy. So even if we wanted to, we could not sell Tails. And that's amazing.

[[Since 2014|doc/about/finances]], we raised 210'000€ on average each year, coming from:

  - People like you (17%)
  - Private companies like Mozilla or DuckDuckGo (15%)
  - Foundations and NGOs like Hivos and Access Now (34%)
  - Entities related to the US government like the Open Technology Fund (OTF)
    or the National Democratic Institute (NDI) (34%)

Many times we hear complains about the fact that many
software projects that are meant to fight against surveillance, like Tor and
Tails, get a lot of funding from the US government whose own surveillance
projects have been severely criticized. We completely share this concern and
we will worry about our accountability and sustainability as long as the
survival of our project depends on a few small grants, some of them coming from
organizations linked to governments.

Now, we would like you to think about it: where should our money come from?

The answer is clear for us: the survival of Tails should be guaranteed by our
users themselves, so that in return, we can continue to use our money in the
best interest of our users, with complete independence.

From anonymized statistics on our website we know that around 17'000 people use
Tails every day. If each of them donated 12€, the price of a USB stick, our
budget for the whole year would be raised in a single day. As you can see, this
is a realistic goal and a ridiculous budget compared to the multibillionaire
companies and agencies running the surveillance business.

But many of our users could actually get in
trouble if they donated to an anti-surveillance tool like Tails. So when donating to Tails
you are also helping all of these people by keeping Tails alive. Please
consider setting up a yearly or monthly donation.
 
Our goals for the coming years
==============================

We will use it to do [[all this|/blueprint/roadmap/]].
