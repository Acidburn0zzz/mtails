[[!meta title="Donation campaign for 2016"]]

We are preparing here possible blog posts for the [[!tails_ticket 9855
desc="donation campaign of 2016"]].

Here are the ideas we had were we initially drafted the plan. The
splitting and structure of the different posts is unclear but we should
cover more or less:

1. Launching and explaining the campaign
   - Explain our budget and what we use the money for
   - Explain why donations are important to remain independent
   - Explain again why Tails comes for free
1. Recap all the great things we did since the last donation campaign
1. Reuse the old post about who you are helping when donating to Tails
1. Explain our roadmap
1. Thank you!

Regarding the writing style, I would stay we should be:

  - Short but not too much. Something you can read in 2 minutes, some
    300 words, etc.

  - Make people understand better our work, how we function, and why we
    need this money (instead of asking for it for charity). This implies
    being informative and backing up our words with facts and figures
    (budget, past achievements, etc.)

  - Cross-reference previous blog posts in the campaign.

  - Try to be visual (graphics, screenshots, photos, etc.).

  - Maybe include template for tweets.
