[[!meta title="Donation campaign for 2016"]]

Here are the ideas we had were we initially drafted the plan. The
splitting and structure of the different posts is unclear but we should
cover more or less:

1. Thank you!

Regarding the writing style, I would stay we should be:

  - Short but not too much. Something you can read in 2 minutes, some
    300 words, etc.

  - Make people understand better our work, how we function, and why we
    need this money (instead of asking for it for charity). This implies
    being informative and backing up our words with facts and figures
    (budget, past achievements, etc.)

  - Cross-reference previous blog posts in the campaign.

  - Try to be visual (graphics, screenshots, photos, etc.).

  - Maybe include template for tweets.

Our plans for the coming years
==============================

As part of our ongoing donation campaign, we already explained you [[why
we needed donations]] and [[how we use these donations]]. Today we are
sharing with you our plans for the next years:

  - **Easier adoption**
    - **Revamp Tails Greeter**: make it easier to configure Tails when starting ([[!tails_ticket 5464]])
    - **Rethink the installation and upgrade process**: take a step back and reflect
      on the future of Tails Installer, the installation on Windows and
      Mac, and automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 11679]])
    - **Graphical installation method for Mac OS**: what would it take
      to document tools other than Tails Installer to do a graphical
      installation from Mac OS? ([[!tails_ticket 11682]])
    - **Explain better what Tails is** and what makes it so awesome ([[!tails_ticket 9814]])

  - **Security hardening**
    - **Reproducible build of the ISO image**: protect users and
      developers from a malicious build of our ISO image ([[!tails_ticket 5630]])
    - **Persistent Tor state**: have persistent entry guards ([[!tails_ticket 5462]])
    - **HTTPS mirrors**: serve our downloads over HTTPS only ([[!tails_ticket 9796]])
    - **Persistent seed for random number generator**: have better entropy and stronger crypto ([[!tails_ticket 7675]])
    - **Browser fingerprint**: compare and reevaluate the web fingerprint of Tor Browser inside and outside Tails ([[!tails_ticket 5362]])

  - **Community**
    - **Web platform for translators**: make it easier to translate our website ([[!tails_ticket 10034]])
    - **Social contract**: guiding principles that reflects the commitment to our ideals ([[!tails_ticket 11669]])
    - **Personas**: study and describe our user base to take better design decisions ([[!tails_ticket 11162]])
    - **Improvements to WhisperBack**: make it easier and faster to answer support requests ([[!tails_ticket 9799]], [[!tails_ticket 9800]])

  - **Sustainability**
    - **Tails based on Debian Stretch** ([Tails 3.0](https://labs.riseup.net/code/versions/278))
    - **Better server infrastructure**: to handle our growing needs on continuous integration and have a backup server ([[!tails_ticket 11680]], [[!tails_ticket 6185]])
    - **Test Tails on ARM**: starting with a few Chromebooks supported by Debian ([[!tails_ticket 11677]])
    - **Tails on tablets**: specify what upstream projects (GNOME, Debian, etc.) should work on to help porting Tails to tablets and smartphones ([[!tails_ticket 10039]])

  - **Fundraising**
    - **Have more reliable and steady sources of income**
    - **Depend less on grants from governments**

  - **New applications and features**
    - **Graphical interface for the Additional Packages persistent feature**: allow users to customize which applications are available in their Tails ([[!tails_ticket 5996]] [[!tails_ticket 9059]])
    - **Backups**: provide a graphical tool to backup the persistent volume ([[!tails_ticket 5301]])
    - **Screen locker**: allow users to lock their session with a password ([[!tails_ticket 5684]])
    - **Tails Server**: run onion services from Tails (VoIP chat rooms, collaboration tools, web servers, messaging servers, etc.) ([[!tails_ticket 5688]])
    - **Tails Verifier**: allow verifying whether a Tails installation has been corrupted ([[!tails_ticket 7496]])
    - **TrueCrypt support in GNOME**: graphical utilities to mount TrueCrypt volumes ([[!tails_ticket 11684]], [[!tails_ticket 6337]])

These are all items that we find important and will to prioritize. But making
them a reality will require lots of work, time, and money; on top of all the
day-to-day work that we do to simply keep Tails alive.

If you want us to get there faster, please take one minute to make a donation.

French journal Mediapart supports Tails, others should too
==========================================================

We are very excited to announce that
[Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr), an independent French investigative
journal, has decided to support Tails financially every year.

[[!img mediapart.png link="no"]]

In the past years Mediapart has played a central role in the revelation
and investigation of several major French political scandals. As such
they are well aware of the digital threats faced by their sources,
their journalists, and their readers.

Tails has gained recognition by being used by Edward Snowden and the
journalists reporting on his NSA leaks in 2014. [According to Barton
Gellman](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa):

« *Privacy and encryption work, but it's too easy to make a mistake that
exposes you. Tails puts the essential tools in one place, with a design
that makes it hard to screw them up. I could not have talked to Edward
Snowden without this kind of protection. I wish I'd had it years ago.* »

Since then [[many journalists around the
world|news/who_are_you_helping#journalists]] understood this approach
and adopted Tails to make it easier to stay safe. As Jean-Marc Manach
puts it:

« *War reporters have to buy helmets, bullet-proof vests and rent
armored cars; journalists using the Internet for their investigations
are much luckier: to be as secured as war reporters, they only have to
download Tails, burn it on a CD, install it on a SD card, and learn the
basics of information and communication security, and it's free!* »

In the same way that news organizations invest in physical security or
proprietary software tools to do their work, news organizations should
also invest in free software tools that, as [security experts like Bruce
Schneier](http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/bruce-schneier-and-eben-moglen-2.html)
have repeatedly stated, are going to be safe:

« *I think most of the public domain privacy tools are going to be safe,
yes. [...] I think that Tails is going to be safe. [...] You know, the
NSA has a big lever when a tool is written closed-source by a for-profit
corporation. There are levers they have that they don't have in the open
source international, altruistic community. And these are generally
written by crypto-paranoids, they're pretty well designed.* »

As such, Tails has been the recommended secure platform
for use with the [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/) and
[GlobaLeaks](https://globaleaks.org/) whistle-blowing platforms.

Talking about the challenges of the adoption of encryption by
journalists, the Internet freedom expert [Christopher Soghoian said
at #EncryptNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JktB6h-qnKA), a
conference on digital security and journalism:

« *News organizations need to also contribute to this community pool of
tools. We need to have [reporters] contributing patches to PGP, OTR, and
Tails. These organizations need to be funding $5k or $10k improvements
to make these tools better. Because everyone is relying on these tools
and none of the major organizations that are actually benefiting them
are actually contributing to their development.* »

Mediapart is the first news organization to officially endorse Tails
and answer our call for donations. We hope they are not going to be the
last. Will you join Mediapart in becoming a structural donor?
