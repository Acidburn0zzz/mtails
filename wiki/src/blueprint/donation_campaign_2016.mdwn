[[!meta title="Donation campaign for 2016"]]

Here are the ideas we had were we initially drafted the plan. The
splitting and structure of the different posts is unclear but we should
cover more or less:

Regarding the writing style, I would stay we should be:

  - Short but not too much. Something you can read in 2 minutes, some
    300 words, etc.

  - Make people understand better our work, how we function, and why we
    need this money (instead of asking for it for charity). This implies
    being informative and backing up our words with facts and figures
    (budget, past achievements, etc.)

  - Cross-reference previous blog posts in the campaign.

  - Try to be visual (graphics, screenshots, photos, etc.).

  - Maybe include template for tweets.
