User research
=============

Research questions
------------------

### Success

- How many people use VeraCrypt in Tails after our work in
  comparison with before?
- How many people who were using VeraCrypt outside of Tails but
  couldn't use it in Tails use it after our work?

### Scope

- Which fraction of VeraCrypt volume are encrypted file containers?
  encrypted partitions?
- Are people encrypting their full operating system with VeraCrypt?
- Which fraction of users are using hidden volumes?
- Which fraction of users are using keyfiles? Why? How?

### Behaviors

- Do people share files between Tails and their regular operating
  system? If so how?
- Can we rely on file containers having a .tc or .hc extension?

Where to ask our questions
--------------------------

- Inside Tails:
  - /home
  - /doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt
  - Tails channel on Reddit

- Outside Tails:
  - XXX

Notes on using VeraCrypt
------------------------

- I couldn't manage to encrypt a whole device.
- I couldn't manage to create a new encrypted partition (only reformat
  an existing one).
- I couldn't manage to encrypt the *second* partition on a disk (only
  the first one).
- VeraCrypt has a "Mount" and "Auto-Mount Devices".
- VeraCrypt doesn't enforce or guide in creating the '.hc' extension.

Misc
----

- Check what security guides are recommending:
  - Talking to Security-in-a-Box we should focus on file containers and
    hidden volumes in file containers. Because people are using other
    tools for disk encryption and file containers also limit a bit the
    amount of access that other operating systems have to the files
    (avoids to have the partition full of viruses).
