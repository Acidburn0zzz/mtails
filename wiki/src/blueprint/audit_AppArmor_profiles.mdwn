Things to check
===============

* the kludges needed to make them work with aufs
* access to files via alternate paths specific to Debian Live systems,
  e.g.
  - check `private-files` and `private-files-strict` abstractions, in
    particular wrt. whatever can be accessed via the following paths
  - `/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/`
  - `/lib/live/mount/rootfs/`
  - `/lib/live/mount/overlay/`
    * `apparmor-adjust-home-tunable.diff` adds
      `/lib/live/mount/overlay/home/` to `HOMEDIRS`, so at least
      `$HOME` is OK
* access to webcam
* access to microphone (can we easily block that while still allowing
  sound output?)
* wide-open access to `$HOME`
* wide-open access to `$HOME` except blacklist -- is that good enough?
  shall we add to the blacklist?
* jvoisin's profile hardening
  - Pidgin
    * drop `bash` abstraction: has been here since the first version
      of the profile; that abstraction is not too scary, but... what
      is it useful for?
    * disable video and audio visualization capabilities: if it
      doesn't break e.g. accessibility or sound notifications, why not
  - `/usr/bin/evince`
    * drop `bash` abstraction: same as Pidgin
    * drop `audio` and `ubuntu-media-players` abstraction:  note that
      PDF can embed videos; do we care?
    * drop `ubuntu-console-browsers`, `ubuntu-console-email` and
      `ubuntu-gnome-terminal` abstractions: I doubt it's useful to
      anyone in Tails, indeed
    * disallow `/usr/bin/yelp`: if it breaks displaying Evince help,
      we don't want that
    * disallow `/usr/bin/bug-buddy`: Ubuntu-specific, we don't care
    * disallow `/usr/bin/exo-open` and a bunch of file managers that
      are not shipped in Tails:  not worth maintaining a delta
    * disallow `/usr/bin/gedit`: a comment in the profile says it's
      useful "for text attachments", and given it's inheriting the
      current profile it's not scary enough to be worth potentially
      breaking things
  - `/usr/bin/evince-previewer`
    * same changes as in `/usr/bin/evince` profile, same comments
    * drop `ubuntu-browsers` abstraction: it doesn't cover Tor Browser
      anyway, so why not
    * drop `ubuntu-email` abstraction: do we care about Evince
      previewer being able to start Claws Mail? What is it useful for?
    * disallow networking access: the Debian kernel doesn't support
      such rules anyway, so that would be a no-op

Things to keep in mind
======================

* Beware not to break assistive technologies (accessibility).

Checked already
===============

* Ux rules don't sanitize `$PATH`
  (<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apparmor/+bug/1045986>) =>
  they must only be used to run software that does *not* rely on
  `$PATH` for executing other stuff; in particular, many shell scripts
  do rely on `$PATH`; this should be checked particularly for the
  profiles we ship that don't come from AppArmor upstream, most
  notably:
  - the Tor Browser one: **OK**, the only `Ux` rule it has is about an
    ELF executable
  - Pidgin profile: was vulnerable via `/usr/local/bin/tor-browser`,
    fixed in `bugfix/8007-AppArmor-hardening`
  - `abstractions/tor`: only `Ux` rules are about ELF executables
  - no other relevant `Ux` rule are present in the profiles we ship
* use of `sanitized_helper` [isn't very
  safe](http://blog.azimuthsecurity.com/2012/09/poking-holes-in-apparmor-profiles.html),
  especially given it [doesn't transition properly with
  Pix](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apparmor/+bug/1042771)
  => we don't add occurrences thereof in our own profiles
