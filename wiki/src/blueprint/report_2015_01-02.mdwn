[[!meta title="Tails report for January and February, 2015"]]

Welcome to the new Tails report!
This edition is more complete than last time. We have some good news to share, and you can also see that we did some good work. If you have suggestions about what to include next time, please write to tails-project about it :)

[[!toc  ]]

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.2.3 was released on January 15, 2015.|news/version_1.2.3]] (minor release)
* [[Tails 1.3 was released on February 24, 2015.|news/version_1.3]] (major release)
* The next release (1.3.1) is [[planned for the 7th of April|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

The complete list of improvements is in the release announces. Some major points are:

* Distribute a hybrid ISO image again: no need for anyone to manually run isohybrid anymore!
* Tails now ships the electrum bitcoin client.
* Support obfs4 Tor bridges.

You can also contribute, see our call for help: [[Help have a Windows camouflage in Tails Jessie!|news/windows_camouflage_jessie]]

Documentation and website
=========================

- We completely rewrote the documentation on [[virtualization|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization]]. It now makes it clearer what is virtualization, what are the [[security implications|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization#security]] and provides detailed instructions on how to setup Tails in [[VirtualBox|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virtualbox]], [[virt-manager|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager]], and [[GNOME Boxes|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/boxes]], either straight from ISO, from a [[physical USB stick|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager#usb]], or from a [[virtual USB stick|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager#virtual_usb]].

- We explained the risks of [[accessing internal
  hard|doc/encryption_and_privacy/your_data_wont_be_saved_unless_explicitly_asked]] disks from Tails.

- ... and plenty of small improvements everywhere :)

Infrastructure
==============

* Our test suite covers 172 scenarios, 85 (!) more that in July 2014. That's a huge improvement, because each release can be automatically tested to avoid regressions, instead of having people perform the same tests manually each time. There is still some way to go, but someday releasing will be fast, safe and easy :)

* Tails ships a new certificate in 1.2.3, and a new signing key in 1.3.

* FIXME more to tell ?

On-going discussions
====================

There is lots of work going on to have a [[new Greeter design|blueprint/greeter_revamp_UI/]].
You can read the [discussion on the mailing-list](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-February/000256.html) or follow the [[!tails_ticket 8235]].

FIXME more ?

Funding
=======

Laura Poitras and Edward Snowden won [[Ridenhour's film award for Citizenfour|http://www.nationinstitute.org/blog/prizes/4376/%22citizenfour%22_will_receive_the_ridenhour_documentary_film_prize/]] and offer the $10K prize to Tails - thanks, Laura and Edward! (and congratulations for the Oscar)

The Freedom Of The Press Foundation continues [[their crowdfunding campaign|https://freedom.press//bundle/encryption-tools-journalists]] for Tails (and other great projects!). Of course, there are [[many other ways to donate|contribute/how/donate]] if you want to help :)

FIXME

Outreach
========

Tails now has a [[code of conduct|contribute/working_together/code_of_conduct]]!

Some Tails developers attended [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) in Brussels, saw some interesting talks and I hear the belgian beer was good.

A Tails developer was in Italy... FIXME: Roma

Press & Testimonials
====================

Four major french-speaking medias (Le Monde, La Libre Belgique, Le Soir de Bruxelles and RTBF - radio-télévision belge) have launched [Source Sûre](https://sourcesure.eu/), a whistleblowing platform, in french, that uses Tails.

Many people seemed excited to hear about the bitcoin wallet in Tails and wrote about it. Welcome, bitcoin community :)

UX
==

- We discussed a solution for a [[screen
  locker|blueprint/screen_locker]] that could be reused by other live
  distributions.

- We [reviewed](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8235#note-11) the
  latest mockups of the [[new Tails Greeter|blueprint/greeter_revamp_UI]]
  with usability experts.

- We analyzed in depth the process for new users to [[get started with
  Tails|blueprint/bootstrapping]] and made plans to adjust the relevant
  tools ([[Tails Installer|blueprint/bootstrapping/installer]],
  [[browser extension|blueprint/bootstrapping/extension]], [[Tails
  Upgrader|blueprint/bootstrapping/upgrade]], and [[web
  assistant|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]]).
