# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.1 Research user needs and development costs

We bootstrapped the project, discussed internally a calendar for the UX
design sprint, the beta version, and the final release.

**User needs**: We benchmarked different [open source survey
platforms](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-September/003472.html)
and decided to use [*LimeSurvey*](https://www.limesurvey.org/) to
conduct the online quantitative survey that will help us determine which
features and use cases for VeraCrypt we should prioritize in the best
interest of both our existing and prospective user base.

**Development costs**:
We looked at the relevant code bases of udisks and GNOME Disks to get a rough estimate of the development cost to implement the VeraCrypt support.

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks
We extended udisks to support locking and unlocking of VeraCrypt volumes. The code is available in [a udisks fork on GitHub](https://github.com/segfault3/udisks/tree/support-truecrypt).

# B. Additional software

We bootstrapped the project, discussed internally a calendar for the UX
design sprint, the beta version, and the final release.
