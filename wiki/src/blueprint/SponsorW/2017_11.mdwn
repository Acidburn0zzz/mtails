This report covers the activity of Tails in November 2017.

Everything in this report is public.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

- The survey on VeraCrypt usage that we launched in October was
  advertised on our website until December 1. We got 1012 complete
  answers. ([[!tails_ticket 14474]])

- We recruited participants for the UX design sprint on VeraCrypt in
  Tails what will happen in Berlin from December 8 to 10. We got 91
  people volunteering to help us and selected the 10 most interesting
  profiles to come work with us in December. We gave priority to people
  who are users of both VeraCrypt and Tails and who seem less
  tech-savvy. ([[!tails_ticket 14742]])

- We announced and discussed our plan to integrate VeraCrypt support
  into GNOME Disks to the upstream developers via their
  [mailinglist](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/devkit-devel/2017-November/thread.html).
  We received several positive answers to our effort and a plan proposed
  by the upstream developers revealed itself as having already partly
  been implemented by us in the proposed manner. We are glad to see that
  upstream is very responsive and helpful. ([[!tails_ticket 12275]])
  We're now looking forward to the UX design sprint in order to move our
  developments further forward.
