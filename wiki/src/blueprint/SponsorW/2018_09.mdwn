## B.2 Write technical design documentation

## B.3 Write automated tests

We wrote a number of automated tests to ensure we notice important
regressions in the _VeraCrypt_ support introduced in Tails 3.9.
We have specified the [high-level behavior in
Gherkin](https://gitlab.com/Tails/tails/blob/test/14471-veracrypt/features/veracrypt.feature)
then implemented the corresponding steps. All this work is now pending
our internal code review and should be merged by the end of October
([[!tails_ticket 14471]], [[!tails_ticket 14469]], [[!tails_ticket
15238]], [[!tails_ticket 15239]]).

## B.8 Fix bugs and UX issues

- We have investigated and fixed a regression introduced in Tails 3.9:
  the _Persistence Configuration_ was displayed full screen in some
  specific screen resolutions, which made the software harder to use.
