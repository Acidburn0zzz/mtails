## A.2 UX & UI design sprint

The main developer and the UX designer working on this project gathered for
three days of sprint in Berlin, at the Onion Space, a coworking space for
Internet freedom technologists, on January 27, 28, and 29.

We followed a very similar methodology as the one we described in more
details when we reported on the [[UX design sprint for VeraCrypt support
in GNOME|contribute/reports/SponsorW/2017_12#sprint]].

### Design studio

We started with a [design
studio](https://articles.uie.com/design_studio_methodology/) to ideate
and come up with a first candidate design.

### Paper prototyping and formative testing with users

We prepared paper prototypes of this first candidate. Over the week-end,
we had 7 people come over for testing sessions of one hour each. After
each test we debriefed our findings and improved our design.

We selected people with diverse prior knowledge about how to install
packages in Tails (and Linux in general). All were familiar with Tails
(though in various degrees) but some were otherwise Windows or macOS
users while some were Debian experts or used to Linux distributions with
a different packaging system.

### Output

The full list of interfaces that we designed can be seen on our
[[blueprint|blueprint/additional_software_packages/gui]].
