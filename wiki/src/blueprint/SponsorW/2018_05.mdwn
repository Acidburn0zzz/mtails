Everything in this report is public.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

# B. Additional software

## A.8 User testing & community feedback

We completed the user testing of the beta version of this feature.

We organized an in-person moderated user testing with 5 participants. We
recruited participants who are in the target audience for this feature: people
who had tried Tails a few times but who were not expert users.

The interface that we designed in January worked really well. Only one
participant had a very bad time and failed some of the missions.

Most issues are around the interface itself: they are integration issues
or issues in other parts of Tails, in GNOME, or in the navigation on our
website and documentation.

The average SUS score is of 68 which is considered right on average compared to
other industry products.

A more detailed report was sent to our UX mailing list:
