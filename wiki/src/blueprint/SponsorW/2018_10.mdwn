[[!meta title="Tails October 2018 report"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

This report covers the activity of Tails in October 2018.

All remaining tasks were completed.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.3 Write automated tests

We made good progress on this task:

- The high-level behavior, specified in Gherkin, passed our internal
  review process. ([[!tails_ticket 14576]])
- The corresponding test cases were implemented, reviewed, and will be
  merged soon after some final polishing and performance optimization.
  ([[!tails_ticket 14596]])

This task is now complete.

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks

We sent
a [proposal](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/issues/589)
to udisks upstream for enabling VeraCrypt support by default: in
order to enable this support, one currently needs to create an empty
file somewhere as an administrator. This is outside of the scope of
this project but we would like to go the extra mile and ensure all
GNOME users can benefit from our work without having to do anything
special. Our proposal was well received. ([[!tails_ticket 15615]])

## A.6 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Files

We continuously updated our remaining upstream merge requests. Some of
them could not be reviewed yet due to a GNOME development scheduling
matter: the target branch of the merge is not opened for integrating
new code yet. We will keep following up on this front and we are
confident all our code will be merged upstream eventually.

This task is now complete.

## A.8 User testing & community feedback

Since July, we've continuously gathered feedback from users about this
new feature. This allowed us to identify a number of technical and
usability issues that were subsequently prioritized. The most
important ones were solved as part of activity A.9.

We've ensured *WhisperBack* includes additional debugging information
that we need to analyze the bug reports users send us about this
feature. ([[!tails_ticket 15966]])

This task is now complete.

## A.9 Fix bugs and UX issues

We fixed two usability issues:

 - The unlock dialogs contained UI elements for an option (PIM) which
   will only be supported once Tails is based on Debian Buster.
   ([[!tails_ticket 16031]])
 - udisks did not recognize volumes with multiple encryption as unlocked,
   which resulted in confusing messages being displayed to the user.
   ([[!tails_ticket 15967]], [[!tails_ticket 15733]])

We noticed a couple of minor accessibility issues in GNOME Disks:
a widget we added for VeraCrypt support is unreachable when using only
the keyboard and lacks the information needed for screen reader to
present it. We've created an upstream issue about the former and
a merge request about the latter. ([[!tails_ticket 15952]])

The last potential bug we had on our radar is that one needs an
administration password to unlock some VeraCrypt volumes. Our analysis
lead us to conclude that this problem was a side-effect of another bug
that was itself fixed in Tails 3.10.1. And indeed, since that release
we did not receive any new report about this. ([[!tails_ticket 15757]])

This task is now complete.

## A.10 Port to the latest version of GNOME

We documented how to backport the code that was merged or submitted
upstream to the version of the Debian packages we use in Tails, which
made us reach the goal of this activity: this code works both in the
latest version of GNOME and in the version we currently use in Tails.
([[!tails_ticket 15524]])

This task is now complete.

## A.11 Project management

This task was completed.

# B. Additional software

## B.2 Write technical design documentation

This task was completed: the [[technical design documentation for
Additional Software|/contribute/design/additional_software_packages]]
has been merged and published on our website.

## B.3 Write automated tests

This task was completed.

Both the [high-level
behavior](https://gitlab.com/Tails/tails/blob/test/14471-veracrypt/features/veracrypt.feature),
that we specified in Gherkin and the implementation of the
corresponding tests passed our review process and were merged.
([[!tails_ticket 14471]], [[!tails_ticket 14469]], [[!tails_ticket
15238]], [[!tails_ticket 15239]])

## B.7 User testing & community feedback

Since May, we've continuously gathered feedback from users about this
new feature. This allowed us to identify a number of technical and
usability issues that were subsequently prioritized. The most
important ones were solved as part of activity B.8.

This task is now complete.

## B.8 Fix bugs and UX issues

This task was completed:

- Our fix for a regression introduced in Tails 3.9 (the _Persistence
  Configuration_ was displayed full screen in some specific screen
  resolutions, which made the software harder to use) passed the code
  review and will be included in the next version of Tails.
  ([[!tails_ticket 15894]])

- We fixed another bug that would sometimes ask on every boot if an already
  configured set of Additional Software needs to be made
  persistent. ([[!tails_ticket 15893]])

## B.9 Project management

This task was completed.

# C. Deliver new features

Our work to unlock VeraCrypt volumes in GNOME has landed upstream and
is therefore being included in other distributions, as mentioned in the
[release announcement of Ubuntu Cosmic
Cuttlefish](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/10/19/welcome-ubuntu-desktop-18-10).

## C.4 Server hardware

This task was completed: we have purchased hardware to increase our
storage capacity and keep supporting the Tails development process.
