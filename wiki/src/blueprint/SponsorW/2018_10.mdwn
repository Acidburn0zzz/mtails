Everything in this report is public.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks

- We sent
  a [proposal](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/issues/589)
  to udisks upstream for enabling VeraCrypt support by default: in
  order to enable this support, one currently needs to create an empty
  file somewhere as an administrator. This is outside of the scope of
  this project but we would like to go the extra mile and ensure all
  GNOME users can benefit from our work without having to do anything
  special. Our proposal was well received. ([[!tails_ticket 15615]])

# B. Additional software

## B.3 Write automated tests

This task was completed:

- The [high-level
  behavior](https://gitlab.com/Tails/tails/blob/test/14471-veracrypt/features/veracrypt.feature),
  that we specified in Gherkin in September, passed our internal
  review process.

- The implementation of the corresponding tests passed an initial code
  review and should be merged by the time this report is published.

## B.8 Fix bugs and UX issues

- Our fix for a regression introduced in Tails 3.9 (the _Persistence
  Configuration_ was displayed full screen in some specific screen
  resolutions, which made the software harder to use) passed the code
  review and will be included in the next version of Tails.
