[[!meta title="Bootable USB disk image"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

# Motivation

This is about generating, distributing and installing Tails as a disk
image that, once copied bit-by-bit to a USB stick, produces a _final
Tails_ (GPT, UEFI-bootable, ready to get a persistent volume).

This would:

 - avoid the need for a second USB stick and an intermediary Tails
   during the initial installation and full manual upgrade; as
   a consequence:
   - big UX win
   - avoid the
     [[!tails_ticket 12146 desc="intermediary Tails not being bootable on many UEFI systems"]]
     problem
   - removes a blocker for
     [[!tails_ticket 6560 desc="Secure Boot support"]] (a non-GPT
     intermediary Tails would never work with Secure Boot enabled)
 - allow us to use simpler, more reliable installers at least on
   Windows and macOS and then:
   - avoids user confusion that results in creating a non-bootable
     device e.g. [[!tails_ticket 13206]]
   - relying on third-party tools becomes less painful
 - pave the way to a self-extracting file offered for download,
   that would bundle the disk image, the program used to copy it to
   the target device, and some wrapper that would run that program
   with the right arguments

# Generating

`live-build` can generate `hdd` images. Alternatively, we can
post-process our ISO image to create a USB-bootable disk image.

Open questions:

 - What size should the system partition be? Do we grow the system
   partition on first boot (from the initramfs) e.g.
   with [[!debpts cloud-init]] or the Rasbian tools
   (<https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/>,
   <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>)?
 - What about DVD support? Can we stop distributing an ISO image
   some day?

# Distributing

XXX: impact on mirrors' storage space?

# Installing

## from Windows

### Etcher

See below "from macOS".

### Rufus

- [homepage](https://rufus.akeo.ie)
- CLI mode: [in progress](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/issues/111) but not on priority list of the developer
- Complicated UX
  - too many options
  - need to download supplementary files for syslinux version
  - not clear which partition scheme to use even though it selects one
    automatically
  - user has to manually choose to install our ISOhybrided image either using
    ISO or DD mode.
- License: GnuGPL
- [[!tails_ticket 10984]]: Boots (tested in legacy mode)
  - When burnt in "DD" mode, the checksums match!
- [Recommended by Ubuntu for Windows](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1)

### Win32 Disk Imager

[[!tails_ticket 14447]]

- https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

## from macOS

### Etcher

(February 2018)

 - [homepage](https://etcher.io)
 - Windows, macOS, Linux (deb & rpm)
 - no official Debian images
 - CLI mode: [Etcher CLI](https://etcher.io/cli/) is experimental, it's a
   different executable than the GUI one, so we can suppose that it can't be run
   to launch the GUI with the right options.
 - License: Apache
 - [[!tails_ticket 11348]]: images created with Etcher boot (in legacy mode at least) and checksums match
 - [It is recommended by Ubuntu for macOS](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#3)

### macOS Disk Utility

- included in OS

## from Linux

_GNOME Disks_ has a _Restore Disk Image_ feature that basically does
`dd` with a nice progress bar.

# Upgrading

This approach does not make full, manual upgrades any simpler. For the
ideas we have to fix that other problem, see [[!tails_ticket 11131]]
and [[blueprint/Endless_upgrades]].
