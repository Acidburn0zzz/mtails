## General requirements

**MUST**

- work over Tor / SOCKS
- provide end-to-end-encryption (OTR, some kind of ratcheting)

**SHOULD**

- provide a desktop client
- be mass-adopted already
- allow for instant messaging
- allow for video calls
- allow for audio calls

## Possible candidates:

### Telegram

- works over Tor (You can configure Tor as a SOCKS5 proxy in the configuration. The traffic seems to go through HTTP.)
- is in Debian https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/telegram-desktop
- When first starting the app, you have to enter your phone number and validate it through an SMS. Then you get all your messages and conversations back, even your stickers!
- So it's not anonymous in the sense that it's linked with your phone number but it's super easy :)
- instant messaging

### Signal

- centralized server
- mass adopted
- currently Chromium extension, will they port to FF? 
- Tor?
- double ratchet
- have to enter a phone number
- instant messaging

### Matrix

- decentralized
- TLS by default
- Tor?

### Wire

- desktop client
- but no proxy/Tor support?
- video & audio calls
- instant messaging

### Ring.cx

- end-to-end encrypted
- video calls

### Briar

- decentralized
- works over Tor
- no Linux client yet
