  status summary:

  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.1.1. Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard

Despite having thouroughly tested our work on reenabling the autoconfiguration
wizard in Icedove, we received reports, that in some cases where the ISP uses OAuth,
as for example Gmail, people were unable to set up an email account. One of these issues, the spurious inability to set up accounts, has been resolved and will be available in the next Tails release ( [[!tails_ticket 11550]]). The OAuth issue has been identified and is currently being worked on ([[!tails_ticket 11536]]). A third issue concerning intermittently failing TLS connections needs more testing ([[!tails_ticket 10933]]).

## A.1.2. Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove

Our second iteration of our patches for Icedove has been reviewed and
integration with upstream's testing suite has been asked for in reply.
We've been working on writing tests for our patches, but another
iteration of those is necessary. See the
[[!mozbug 971347 desc="upstream bug"]] for details.

The Tor project has released
[Torbirdy 0.2.0](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torbirdy-020-sixth-beta-release)
on June 27th 2016. This release contains patches we wrote,
as well as patches by Arthur Edelstein, that fix the privacy leaks
identified initially by taqnaq. An updated Debian package is currently
being uploaded.

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

The system has been working fine in production for a while now, and as
reported last month all parts of this deliverable have now been completed.

In June, we have polished a bit the design documentation for the
entire setup ([[!tails_ticket 11447]]).

And, in July we want to do various polishing tasks:

* If needed, write helper tools for freeze exceptions
  ([[!tails_ticket 11448]]).

* Investigate a weird issue we have identified, when a package is
  not removed from our time-based APT snapshots, while it should be
  ([[!tails_ticket 11496]]).

* Deal with the consequences that our new APT snapshots system has
  on our server's `apt-cacher-ng` cache size ([[!tails_ticket 11532]]).

# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors

We now have 39 active mirrors.

The work that remains to be done in July is:

- C.1.2. Write & audit the code that makes the redirection decision from our website ([[!tails_ticket 8639]], [[!tails_ticket 8640]], [[!tails_ticket 11109]])

  * `mirror-dispatcher.js`: we are still waiting for the auditor to do
    a final security review.

  * Download And Verification Extension (DAVE) for Firefox: the code
    needs to be reviewed by the original author of the extension and the
    code for resuming downloads still needs to be improved and tested.

- C.1.8. Clean up the remainders of the old mirror pool setup ([[!tails_ticket 8643]], [[!tails_ticket 11284]])

  This is now only blocked by the work that is in progress on DAVE
  (C.1.2).

## C.4. Maintain our already existing services

- C.4.6. Administer our services up to milestone VI

  We kept on answering the requests from the community and taking care
  of security updates.

  We [[!tails_ticket 11213 desc="refactored"]] the Puppet bits that
  configure our servers' firewall.

  We debugged and fixed a nasty problem that prevented the `testing`
  Git branch from being automatically tested on our infrastructure
  ([[!tails_ticket 11499]]).

  One of us participated in a Puppet sprint at
  [DebCamp](https://debconf16.debconf.org/), where a team did improved
  the `puppet` and `apt` modules we are using on our infrastructure.

# D. Migration to Debian Jessie


# E. Release management
