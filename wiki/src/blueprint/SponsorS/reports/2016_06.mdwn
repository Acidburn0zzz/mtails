  status summary:

  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.1.1. Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard

XXX: maybe mention the follow-up work that happened in this area (I'm
thinking of [[!tails_ticket 11550]]) even though this deliverable was
completed last month?

## A.1.2. Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove

Our second iteration of our patches for Icedove has been reviewed and
integration with upstream's testing suite has been asked for in reply.
We've been working on writing tests for our patches, but another
iteration of those is necessary. See the
[[!mozbug 971347 desc="upstream bug"]] for details.

The Tor project has released
[Torbirdy 0.2.0](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torbirdy-020-sixth-beta-release)
on June 27th 2016. This release contains patches we wrote,
as well as patches by Arthur Edelstein, that fix the privacy leaks
identified initially by taqnaq. An updated Debian package is currently
being uploaded.

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

The system has been working fine in production for a while now, and as
reported last month all parts of this deliverable have now been completed.

In June, we have polished a bit the design documentation for the
entire setup ([[!tails_ticket 11447]]).

And, in July we want to do various polishing tasks:

* If needed, write helper tools for freeze exceptions
  ([[!tails_ticket 11448]]).

* Investigate a weird issue we have identified, when a package is
  not removed from our time-based APT snapshots, while it should be
  ([[!tails_ticket 11496]]).

* Deal with the consequences that our new APT snapshots system has
  on our server's `apt-cacher-ng` cache size ([[!tails_ticket 11532]]).

# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors

- C.1.2. Write & audit the code that makes the redirection decision from our website ([[!tails_ticket 8639]], [[!tails_ticket 8640]], [[!tails_ticket 11109]])

  XXX

- C.1.6. Adjust download documentation to point to the mirror pool dispatcher's URL ([[!tails_ticket 8642]], [[!tails_ticket 11329]], [[!tails_ticket 10295]])
