[Last month's activity on Redmine](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=208)
can be helpful.

This reports covers the activity of Tails in September 2016.

Everything in this report is public.

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

- A.1.1. Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard

XXX

- A.1.2. Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove

XXX

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite

### B.3.11. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and faster

Our automated test suite depends on that Tails is started with a
special kernel command-line option entered in the boot menu. This is
done by pressing the TAB key before the menu's timeout starts Tails
with the default options suitable for real use -- if this happens, the
tests will later fail. However, at this stage we can only depend on
what is shown on the screen and sometimes (presumably when the host
running the test suite is under heavy load) the software we use to
find images on the screen is not fast enough, resulting in
failure. Making this part robust is particularly important since it
can make *any* test fail.

This lead us to a rather involved work around essentially emulating a
user repeatedly pressing the required key, ensuring that the timeout
at the boot menu will never happen. But if it happens any way, we will
detect that and reboot, and try again. ([[!tails_ticket 10777]])

### B.3.12. Reliably wait for post-Greeter hooks ([[!tails_ticket 5666]])

This work has been implemented, and is waiting for testing and a code
review.

### B.3.14. Write tests for incremental upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 6309]])

This work has been merged, so this deliverable is now completed.

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

This was completed already, but still we keep improving things
based on feedback resulting from actual usage.

We started to look into optimizing how we store and backup tagged APT
snapshots ([[!tails_ticket 11830]]). Preliminary results
are encouraging!

# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors:

- C.1.2. Write & audit the code that makes the redirection decision from our website

XXX

- C.1.6. Adjust download documentation to point to the mirror pool dispatcher's URL

XXX

- C.1.8. Clean up the remainers of the old mirror pool setup

XXX

## C.4. Maintain our already existing services

### C.4.6. Administer our services upto milestone VI

We kept on answering the requests from the community and taking care
of security updates.

We started optimizing I/O settings for virtual machines running on our
main server ([[!tails_ticket 11817]]). The short-term goal is to get
better performance out of our current hardware; the mid-term goal is
to learn more about our actual setup's capacity in a way that helps us
design the hardware we will purchase in 2017.

We've run some preliminary tests regarding how we can upgrade our
continuous integration system to Jenkins 2.

We ([[!tails_ticket 11384 desc="designed a plan"]] to migrate our
infrastructure to Puppet 4.

We started porting our Puppet code to *puppet-concat* 2.2.0+, that
should help generate files in a more deterministic way
([[!tails_ticket 11242]]).

We started taking over from Riseup the system that hosts our ticket
tracker.

We polished a little bit our Jenkins build products are presented to
our core developers, in order to make their work nicer.
