can be helpful.

This reports covers the activity of Tails in March 2016.

Everything in this report can be made public.

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

- A.1.1 Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard: #6154

Now that we've adapted Thunderbird to use the automatic email creation wizard again, we also needed to adjust some settings in Torbirdy, in order to benefit from both. We've made a lot of progress on adapting Torbirdy's code (#11204) and have sent the [modifications upstream] (https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/pull/30).

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

- B.4.2. Implement a mechanism to save the list of packages used at
  ISO build time ([[!tails_ticket 10748]])

# C. Scale our infrastructure


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie


# E. Release management
