# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite

### B.3.10. Write automated tests for features added in 2016Q1

XXX:intrigeri

### B.3.11. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and faster

XXX: [[!tails_ticket 11588]], [[!tails_ticket 10720]],
[[!tails_ticket 11590]]

We implemented retries on transient network failures in a bunch of the
features of our test suite that were subject to it:

- in the SSH and SFTP feature ([[!tails_ticket 10498]])
- in the APT feature ([[!tails_ticket 10496]])
- in the Git feature ([[!tails_ticket 10444]])
- the Synaptic scenario has a proposed patch that has been widely
  tested and should be merged for 2.6 ([[!tails_ticket 10441]]).
  Hopefully it will also workaround
  [[!tails_ticket 10412 desc="Synaptic segfaults we've seen"]] as well
  as [[!tails_ticket 10900 desc="another related bug"]].

We [[!tails_ticket 11558 desc="identified and fixed"]] a bug in the
step checking that the persistent partition exists.

We [[!tails_ticket 10504 desc="identified and fixed"]] a bug in our
test suite's handling of USB sticks created without Tails Installer,
due to weirdness caused by hybrid ISO images.

While working on tackling the failures of time syncing tests, we
realized that some of the servers we use for htpdate were
offline or broken, making Tails' time syncing brittle.
We [[!tails_ticket 11577 desc="replaced them"]],
which improves the situation.

Our test suite needs to add kernel command line options when booting the
Tails VM under test, so that it can run commands inside it. This step
used to be fragile: it sometimes happened that the Tails VM booted
before our test suite had time to type these options.
We've [[!tails_ticket 10777 desc="implemented a solution"]] that
should be merged in August.

### B.3.12. Reliably wait for post-Greeter hooks ([[!tails_ticket 5666]])

We lacked time to work on this, so it is postponed.

### B.3.13. Reorganize the "various checks" feature ([[!tails_ticket 5707]])

This work has been merged, so this deliverable is now completed.

### B.3.14. Write tests for incremental upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 6309]])

This is still work in progress. We went through one more iteration,
and hope to complete it soon.

### B.3.15. Write automated tests for features added in 2016Q2

We [[!tails_ticket 10840 desc="wrote a regression test"]] for the
persistence "dotfiles" feature. This completes this deliverable.

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

XXX:intrigeri

B.4.3. Centralize and merge the list of needed packages
B.4.5. Implement processes and tools for importing and freezing those packages

# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors

XXX:u

- C.1.2. Write & audit the code that makes the redirection decision from our website ([[!tails_ticket 8639]], [[!tails_ticket 8640]], [[!tails_ticket 11109]])

- C.1.6. Adjust download documentation to point to the mirror pool dispatcher's URL

- C.1.8. Clean up the remainders of the old mirror pool setup ([[!tails_ticket 8643]], [[!tails_ticket 11284]])

## C.4. Maintain our already existing services

  We kept on answering the requests from the community and taking care
