## B.4. Freezable APT repository

This project was still on hold in February, while the developer
responsible for this project was focusing on other matters; we will
resume work on it in March. However, we mistakenly scheduled for
milestone V (April 15) two big projects that have the same developers,
so we decided to spread them more evenly over the remaining five
months of this contract; in April we will focus on C.1 (Change in
depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors), and here is the
updated schedule for the freezable APT repository project.

By the end of March, we want to:

* complete the design and discussion phase, that is "B.4.1.
  Specify when we want to import foreign packages into which APT
  suites" ([[!tails_ticket 9488]]), and "B.4.4. Design freezable APT
  repository" ([[!tails_ticket 9487]]);

* make enough progress on "B.4.2. Implement a mechanism to save the
  list of packages used at ISO build time" so it can be merged in
  April, ideally in time for Tails 2.3;

* have a working proof-of-concept for most other essential pieces of
  infrastructure and code.

Then, after a hiatus in April while we will be focused on our pool of
HTTP mirrors, in May we want to improve the freezable APT repository
as needed, aiming at merging code into the main development branch,
and deploying all pieces of infrastructure in production, by the end
of the month. Our current goal is to build Tails 2.4 (scheduled on
June 7th) using our freezable APT repository.

And then, we will still have two months, until the end of the
contract. This slack might be needed if previous steps take more time
than expected, and if not it will be time for us to identify remaining
issues, gather feedback from release managers and developers, and to
improve tools and documentation as we deem necessary.
