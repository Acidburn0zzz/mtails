[Last month's activity on Redmine](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=208)
can be helpful.

This reports covers the activity of Tails in December 2015.

Everything in this report can be made public.

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.n. description of subsection

- A.n.m. description of deliverable: ticket numbers

  status summary:

  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

- B.4.5. Implement processes and tools for importing and freezing
  those packages ([[!tails_ticket 10749]], [[!tails_ticket 10748]],
  [[!tails_ticket 6299]]),
  B.4.2. Implement a mechanism to save the list of packages used at
  ISO build time ([[!tails_ticket 6297]])

  Some more code was written and reviewed. A few potential issues were
  identified and are being discussed within the team.

- B.4.6. Adjust the rest of our ecosystem to the freezable APT
  repository

  We started an evaluation of the hardware resources required by our
  draft design ([[!tails_ticket 6295]]).

# C. Scale our infrastructure


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie

## D.2. Take advantage of systemd to improve the internals of Tails

We polished code that was previously ported to systemd:

* Fixed `tor-has-bootstrapped` semantics on network reconnect
  ([[!tails_ticket 10732]]).

## D.3. Update our test suite for Tails Jessie

We have updated most of the test suite for Jessie ([[!tails_ticket 7563]]).

Some new test suite robustness problems are left to be addressed, but
the current state was good enough to make us feel comfortable
releasing Tails 2.0~beta1. Besides, we are happy to point out that
this automated test suite made us discover quite a few bugs in
Jessie-based Tails development versions, that we would probably not
have noticed before the first beta release otherwise.

Here is the list of relevant tickets that were resolved during the
reporting period (most of the test suite porting work was done
directly in Git, without filing tickets for each bit that needed to be
adjusted, though):

* Dropped an obsolete test case ([[!tails_ticket 10336]]).
* Disabled screen blanking during the test suite, it breaks some tests ([[!tails_ticket 10403]]).
* Updated the tests for communication with OpenPGP keyservers ([[!tails_ticket 9791]]).
* Replaced our previous iptables status regexp-based parser with a new
  XML-based status analyzer: the previous implementation could not be
  adjusted to the new ip6tables' output ([[!tails_ticket 9704]]).
* Updated the "all notifications have disappeared" test suite step for
  Jessie ([[!tails_ticket 8782]]).

## D.4. Document the changes implied by the move to Jessie on our website

## D.5. Release an official version of Tails based on Jessie

On December 22 we published a first beta for the upcoming Tails 2.0,
based on Debian Jessie: <https://tails.boum.org/news/test_2.0-beta1/>.
It was very useful so far: we received a lot of feedback, including
a few bug reports. Most of these bugs were fixed since then, but that
will be for next report round :)

The first release of Tails based on Debian Jessie is still scheduled
for January 26.

## Various porting to Jessie

A lot of other porting to Jessie work was done, that does not really
fit into any of the above categories:

* Install Electrum 0.2.5.x in Tails/Jessie ([[!tails_ticket 10754]]).
* Fixed obfs4proxy support ([[!tails_ticket 10724]]).
* Fixed time synchronization in bridge mode when the clock is way off
  ([[!tails_ticket 10696]]).

# E. Release management
