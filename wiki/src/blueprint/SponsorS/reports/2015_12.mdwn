[Last month's activity on Redmine](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=208)
can be helpful.

This reports covers the activity of Tails in December 2015.

Everything in this report can be made public.

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.1.3 Integrate Icedove into Tails
   Since 1.8 we advertise Icedove to our users over Claws Mail.
   Users may now use persistence with Icedove.

## A.1.2, Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove
   We've been following up on upstreaming patches from tagnaq's paper
   and are happy to see that two of them were included upstream
   ([[!tails_ticket 6150]])
   * Date headers are sanitized with a JS patch in torbirdy: 
     https://trac.torproject.org/6314
   * Message-ID headers are fixed with a C++ patch in Thunderbird 45: 
     https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/a8573d4c67292962f9dd9b8f51496e9f62bbedb7

  Unfortunately we also discovered that Icedove's autoconfig wizard does
  not always use the configured proxy. This means, that some traffic leaks.
  However, in Tails we drop non-Tor traffic by default, but we think that
  it's important to provide a patch for this bug and started to write a 
  PoC.

  In order to make our improvements maintainaible we've furthermore gotten
  in touch with the Debian Icedove packaging team and writen manual tests for 
  user who help test Icedove in Tails.
  ([[!tails_ticket 9493]])
  These will still be converted to automated tests for our test suite.

## A.1.1 Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard

   We've been evaluating our own patches against Icedove against those
   reported to Mozilla's bugtracker and are happy to announce that our
   patches would provide an option to accept only secure protocols, as
   a user opt-in. These patches will be submitted to Mozilla's bugtracker
   - and hopefully accepted upstream.
   ([[!tails_ticket 7064]])

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.1. Automatically build ISO images for all the branches of our source code that are under active development

In December, **809 ISOs** were automatically built by our Jenkins
instance.

## B.2. Continuously run our entire test suite on all those ISO images once they are built

In December, **788 ISOs** were tested by our Jenkins instance.

- B.2.4. Implement and deploy the best solution from this research

  We implemented our decision regarding documentation branches and
  automated tests. They are now tested only against scenarios that
  depends on the documentation shipped in Tails and not the whole test
  suite, which help in reducing the load on the isotesters.
  ([[!tails_ticket 10492]], [[!tails_ticket 10706]] and [[!tails_ticket 10707]])

  We also excluded work in progress branches from being automatically
  tested in Jenkins, as their meaning is to share work that is not yet
  ready to be merged and they may break the tests, thus notifying
  authors that already know very well that their branch is not reliable
  yet. ([[!tails_ticket 10389]])

  To save a bit of disk space that we need for later work (e.g freezable
  APT repo), we reduced the temporary partitions used by our isotesters
  after evaluating what they really use. ([[!tails_ticket 10396]])

  We also had a look to check if the saving of videos artifacts for
  failing scenarios after doing so for a release cycle wasn't using too
  much disk space, and concluded it was fine. ([[!tails_ticket 10354]])

  We also fixed a usability issue where the unmerged branches were
  removed from the list of branches to be automatically built and tested
  after each releases, resulting in loosing their automatic build and
  test history. ([[!tails_ticket 10123]])

  We finally unleashed the automated tests failure notifications to
  branches authors, as there were now much less false positives.
  ([[!tails_ticket #10296]] and [[!tails_ticket 10382]])

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

- B.4.5. Implement processes and tools for importing and freezing
  those packages ([[!tails_ticket 10749]], [[!tails_ticket 10748]],
  [[!tails_ticket 6299]]),
  B.4.2. Implement a mechanism to save the list of packages used at
  ISO build time ([[!tails_ticket 6297]])

  Some more code was written and reviewed. A few potential issues were
  identified and are being discussed within the team.

- B.4.6. Adjust the rest of our ecosystem to the freezable APT
  repository

  We started an evaluation of the hardware resources required by our
  draft design ([[!tails_ticket 6295]]).

# C. Scale our infrastructure


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie

## D.2. Take advantage of systemd to improve the internals of Tails

We polished code that was previously ported to systemd:

* Fixed `tor-has-bootstrapped` semantics on network reconnect
  ([[!tails_ticket 10732]]).

## D.3. Update our test suite for Tails Jessie

We have updated most of the test suite for Jessie ([[!tails_ticket 7563]]).

Some new test suite robustness problems are left to be addressed, but
the current state was good enough to make us feel comfortable
releasing Tails 2.0~beta1. Besides, we are happy to point out that
this automated test suite made us discover quite a few bugs in
Jessie-based Tails development versions, that we would probably not
have noticed before the first beta release otherwise.

Here is the list of relevant tickets that were resolved during the
reporting period (most of the test suite porting work was done
directly in Git, without filing tickets for each bit that needed to be
adjusted, though):

* Dropped an obsolete test case ([[!tails_ticket 10336]]).
* Disabled screen blanking during the test suite, it breaks some tests ([[!tails_ticket 10403]]).
* Updated the tests for communication with OpenPGP keyservers ([[!tails_ticket 9791]]).
* Replaced our previous iptables status regexp-based parser with a new
  XML-based status analyzer: the previous implementation could not be
  adjusted to the new ip6tables' output ([[!tails_ticket 9704]]).
* Updated the "all notifications have disappeared" test suite step for
  Jessie ([[!tails_ticket 8782]]).

## D.4. Document the changes implied by the move to Jessie on our website

XXX

## D.5. Release an official version of Tails based on Jessie

On December 22 we published a first beta for the upcoming Tails 2.0,
based on Debian Jessie: <https://tails.boum.org/news/test_2.0-beta1/>.
It was very useful so far: we received a lot of feedback, including
a few bug reports. Most of these bugs were fixed since then, but that
will be for next report round :)

The first release of Tails based on Debian Jessie is still scheduled
for January 26.

## Various porting to Jessie

A lot of other porting to Jessie work was done, that does not really
fit into any of the above categories:

* Install Electrum 0.2.5.x in Tails/Jessie ([[!tails_ticket 10754]]).
* Fixed obfs4proxy support ([[!tails_ticket 10724]]).
* Fixed time synchronization in bridge mode when the clock is way off
  ([[!tails_ticket 10696]]).

# E. Release management
