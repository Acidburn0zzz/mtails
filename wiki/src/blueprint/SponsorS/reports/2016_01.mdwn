# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

- A.n.m. description of deliverable: ticket numbers

  status summary:

  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

## A.1.1 Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard

   We've been evaluating our own patches for Icedove against those
   reported to Mozilla's bugtracker and are happy to announce that our
   patches would provide an option to accept only secure protocols, as
   a user opt-in. These patches will be submitted to Mozilla's bugtracker
   and hopefully integrated upstream.
   ([[!tails_ticket 7064]])

## A.1.2 Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove

   Unfortunately we also discovered that the autoconfig wizard of Icedove does
   not always use the configured proxy. This means, that some traffic can leak.
   This is not a security problem in Tails since we drop non-Tor
   traffic by default, but for this very reason in breaks the
   functionality of the autoconfig wizard in the context of Tails.
   We started to write a proof-of-concept patch to fix this bug.

## A.1.6. Release Icedove in Tails

   Icedove was made the default email client in Tails 1.8 (December 15)
   and Claws Mail was removed from Tails in version 2.0 (January 26).

# B. Improve our quality assurance process


# C. Scale our infrastructure


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie

## D.4.1. Document the changes implied by the move to Jessie on our website

   Most of our documentation has been updated to Jessie. For example we
   rewrote entirely the [[introduction to
   GNOME|doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop]].
   While reworking these pages we also simplified and improved some of
   the oldest parts of our documentation.

   The update of our documentation to GNOME Disks 3.12 was drafted but
   not merged yet. The good news is that this process involves new
   contributors who wrote documentation for Tails for the first time.

# E. Release management
