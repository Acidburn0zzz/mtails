[Last month's activity on Redmine](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=208)
can be helpful.

This reports covers the activity of Tails in January 2016.

Everything in this report can be made public.

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.n. description of subsection

- A.n.m. description of deliverable: ticket numbers

  status summary:

  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

## A.1.1 Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard

   We've been evaluating our own patches for Icedove against those
   reported to Mozilla's bugtracker and are happy to announce that our
   patches would provide an option to accept only secure protocols, as
   a user opt-in. These patches will be submitted to Mozilla's bugtracker
   and hopefully integrated upstream.
   ([[!tails_ticket 7064]])

## A.1.2 Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove

   Unfortunately we also discovered that the autoconfig wizard of Icedove does
   not always use the configured proxy. This means, that some traffic can leak.
   This is not a security problem in Tails since we drop non-Tor
   traffic by default, but for this very reason in breaks the
   functionality of the autoconfig wizard in the context of Tails.
   We started to write a proof-of-concept patch to fix this bug which 
   will be submitted upstream in February.

   In order to improve Icedove's security in Tails and avoid unforeseen exploits,
   we started evaluating an AppArmor profile for Icedove ([[!tails_ticket 10750]]).
   We've asked the author to submit it upstream where it's now waiting to be merged.
   In the meantime, we will ship this profile in Tails on our own.

## A.1.6. Release Icedove in Tails

   Icedove was made the default email client in Tails 1.8 (December 15)
   and Claws Mail was removed from Tails in version 2.0 (January 26).

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.1. Automatically build ISO images for all the branches of our source code that are under active development

In January, **757 ISO images** were automatically built by our Jenkins
instance.

We worked on designing and implementing a workaround for an issue in our
autobuild setup: it sometimes happens that a build fails and leaves its
temporary directories. The subsequent builds happening on the same
system then always fail as they lack room in the /tmp/ directory.
([[!tails_ticket 10772]])

## B.2. Continuously run our entire test suite on all those ISO images once they are built

In January, **757 ISO images** were tested by our Jenkins instance.

* B.2.4. Implement and deploy the best solution from this research: [[!tails_ticket 5288]]

  XXX: bertagaz? (backup = intrigeri)

## B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite

* B.3.7. Automatically test behavior on boot medium removal:
  [[!tails_ticket 5472]]

  This was implemented and merged.

* B.3.11. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and faster

  - We've marked some more scenarios as fragile, as we noticed there
    were still some false positives ([[!tails_ticket 10863]]):
    Encrypting and signing a message using an OpenPGP key
    ([[!tails_ticket 10991]]),
    OpenPGP applet key selection window badly handled
    ([[!tails_ticket 10992]]),
    Viewing and printing a PDF file ([[!tails_ticket 10994]]),
    MAC address spoofing ([[!tails_ticket 10774]]),
    Tails Installer ([[!tails_ticket 10720]])

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

This was put aside in January, while the developer responsible for
this project was focusing on porting Tails to Debian Jessie. A little
progress was made nevertheless:

* B.4.6. Adjust the rest of our ecosystem to the freezable APT
  repository: [[!tails_ticket 6303]]

  We completed our evaluation of the hardware resources required by
  our draft design ([[!tails_ticket 6295]]), purchased and set up the
  needed storage ([[!tails_ticket 10851]]). Next step on this front is
  to adjust our backup system, and our fail-over system once we
  have one.

# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.2. Be able to detect within hours failures and malfunction on our services

We're still working on the prototype and it now has a setup for all the
checks we ranked in the blueprint as critical. ([[!tails_ticket 8650]])

This helped us to check how the chosen software is corresponding to the
requirements we defined. An implementation has been proposed.
([[!tails_ticket 8645]])

XXX: bertagaz, new timeline?

XXX: bertagaz, status of each C.2.n deliverable?

## C.4. Maintain our already existing services

We kept on answering the requests from the community as well as taking
care of security updates as covered by "C.4.4. Administer our services
up to milestone IV" and "C.4.5. Administer our services up to milestone
V" until the end of January.

A design to administer our new monitoring machine with Puppet has been
proposed. ([[!tails_ticket 10760]])

We fixed a bug in our Puppet manifests that prevented us to deploy
new ISO tester systems. We improved the toolbox we use to compute
statistics about the load put on our Jenkins workers, and
their performance.

# D. Migration to Debian Jessie

## D.1. Adjust to the change of desktop environment to GNOME Shell

This was completed back in November.

## D.3. Update our test suite for Tails Jessie

This was completed ([[!tails_ticket 7563]]).

The only remaining issues are a few robustness ones, such as
[[!tails_ticket 10900]]. They will be handled as part of the "B.3.11.
Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and
faster" deliverable.

## D.4. Document the changes implied by the move to Jessie on our website

   Most of our documentation has been updated to Jessie. For example we
   rewrote entirely the [[introduction to
   GNOME|doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop]].
   While reworking these pages we also simplified and improved some of
   the oldest parts of our documentation.

   The update of our documentation to GNOME Disks 3.12 was drafted but
   not merged yet. The good news is that this process involves new
   contributors who wrote documentation for Tails for the first time.

## D.5. Release an official version of Tails based on Jessie

We put out a [[release candidate|news/test_2.0-rc1]], that allowed us to
identify and resolve quite a few bugs, such as
[[!tails_ticket 10862]], [[!tails_ticket 10809]], and
[[!tails_ticket 10784]].

Tails 2.0 [[was released|news/version_2.0]] on January 26, as planned.

# E. Release management
