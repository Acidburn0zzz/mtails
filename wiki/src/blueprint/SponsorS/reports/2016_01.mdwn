  status summary:

  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

## A.1.1 Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard

   We've been evaluating our own patches for Icedove against those
   reported to Mozilla's bugtracker and are happy to announce that our
   patches would provide an option to accept only secure protocols, as
   a user opt-in. These patches will be submitted to Mozilla's bugtracker
   and hopefully integrated upstream.
   ([[!tails_ticket 7064]])

## A.1.2 Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove

   Unfortunately we also discovered that the autoconfig wizard of Icedove does
   not always use the configured proxy. This means, that some traffic can leak.
   This is not a security problem in Tails since we drop non-Tor
   traffic by default, but for this very reason in breaks the
   functionality of the autoconfig wizard in the context of Tails.
   We started to write a proof-of-concept patch to fix this bug.

# B. Improve our quality assurance process


# C. Scale our infrastructure


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie


# E. Release management
