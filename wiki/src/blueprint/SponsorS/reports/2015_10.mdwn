# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.n. description of subsection

  - A.1.2. Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove

  - A.1.3. Integrate Icedove into Tails

    We configured Icedove in Tails to match our security goals (#6151),
    as part of this we disabled:

      - The remote email account feature (#10009)
      - The automatic add-on updates (#10428)

  - A.1.4. Provide a migration path for our users from Claws Mail to Icedove

    We studied the most common Claws Mail persistence configuration
    (#9494, #5663), then provided a [[script|misc/claws_to_icedove.sh]]
    (#10453) to migrate POP mailboxes to Icedove and wrote [[migration
    instructions|doc/anonymous_internet/claws_mail_to_icedove]] (#9495)
    for users to migrate their mailboxes, email account settings, and
    address books.

    To make this migration easier to users, we enabled automatically the
    Icedove persistence feature when the Claws Mail persistence was
    enabled (#9498) and add the `nmh` package to Tails.

  - A.1.5. Update Icedove documentation

    The previous Thunderbird documentation was [[completely
    rewritten|doc/anonymous_internet/icedove]]. (#7158)

  - A.1.6. Release Icedove in Tails

    Icedove has been added to Tails 1.7. (#10285)

    It is advertised as a technology preview in our [[release
    notes|news/version_1.7]]. We want to have some more advanced users
    test our configuration and the migration process before making
    Icedove the default email client and removing Claws Mail.

# B. Improve our quality assurance process


# C. Scale our infrastructure


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie


# E. Release management
