[Last month's activity on Redmine](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=208)
can be helpful.

This reports covers the activity of Tails in May 2016.

Everything in this report is public.

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.n. description of subsection

- A.n.m. description of deliverable: ticket numbers

  status summary:

  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

The work we have done has been reviewed, merged into the main Tails
development branch, and successfully used while preparing Tails
2.4~rc1. Unsurprisingly, we had to fix a couple small bugs that
earlier testing had not discovered, but all in all we're very
satisfied by how the whole thing work: it has been very solid and
performed pretty well so far. We are proud to point to the first ever
tagged snapshot, that contains only the set of packages needed for
building Tails 2.4~rc1, and the corresponding source code:
<http://tagged.snapshots.deb.tails.boum.org/2.4-rc1/>.

Now, let's dive into the details:

- B.4.3. Centralize and merge the list of needed packages

  As [[explained previously|contribute/reports/SponsorS/2015/2016_03#index4h2]],
  the original definition of this deliverable doesn't make sense
  anymore, so here we are reporting about what now replaces it:

  * Allow storing APT snapshots longer than the default when needed:
    the code was reviewed, merged, and successfully used in production
    while preparing Tails 2.4~rc1, so this is completed.

  * Freeze and unfreeze the APT snapshots used by a branch when
    needed: the code and corresponding documentation were reviewed,
    merged, and used in production, so this is completed.

  So we're happy to report that deliverable B.4.3 has been completed
  in May.

- B.4.5. Implement processes and tools for importing and freezing those packages ([[!tails_ticket 6299]], [[!tails_ticket 6296]])

  As [[said last month|contribute/reports/SponsorS/2015/2016_04]], the
  last remaining bits here are about handling some consequences on
  this system:

  * Garbage collection of APT repository snapshots: this was deployed
    in production and works fine.

  * Manage a very custom configuration for `apt-cacher-ng`: this was
    reviewed, merged, and used in production since then.

  * Manage `reprepro`'s database growth: we still need to document the
    process so that our system administrators know how to apply it
    when needed ([[!tails_ticket 11445]]).

- Miscellaneous follow-ups

  By the end of July, we will also do some polishing in various areas:

  * Polish a bit the design documentation for the entire setup
    ([[!tails_ticket 11447]]).

  * If needed, write helper tools for freeze exceptions
    ([[!tails_ticket 11448]]).

  * Investigate a weird issue we have identified, when a package is
    not removed from our time-based APT snapshots, while it should be
    ([[!tails_ticket 11496]]).

# C. Scale our infrastructure


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie


# E. Release management
