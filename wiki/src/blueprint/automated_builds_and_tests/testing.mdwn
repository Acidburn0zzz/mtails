We already have [[an automated test suite|contribute/release_process/test/automated_tests]].
This page is about tools that could allow us to improve it.

# Tools

## behave

* [homepage](https://github.com/behave/behave)
* Cucumber-like, in Python
* used by GNOME
* examples from the eog source tree, that use *behave* and *dogtail*:
  - [feature](https://git.gnome.org/browse/eog/tree/tests/actions.feature)
  - [steps definition](https://git.gnome.org/browse/eog/tree/tests/steps/steps.py)
* not in Debian (2014/08/05)
* Python (with Jython) is now Sikuli's preferred scripting language;
  it's also the language that has the best maintained bindings to
  interact with libvirt, accessibility technologies, and more
* does *behave* work fine under Jython?

## dogtail

* [homepage](https://fedorahosted.org/dogtail/)
* actively maintained upstream as of 2016-02
* GUI test tool and automation framework written in â€‹Python
* uses Accessibility (a11y) technologies to communicate with
  desktop applications
* used by GNOME in combination with *behave*: see the section about
  that one
* in Debian Wheezy, Jessie, and (as of 2016-02-14) Stretch;
  but the package is orphaned
* how much do we still need Sikuli if we have dogtail?

## autopilot

* [homepage](https://launchpad.net/autopilot)
* "A tool for functional testing of GUI application."
* in Ubuntu, but not in Debian
* [usage documentation](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/autopilot/python/1.5.0/)

## LDTP

LDTP is an open source testing tool that uses computer assistive
technology (accessibility) to automate GUIs. It is (was?) used by GNOME,
Mozilla and others:

* [[!wikipedia Linux_Desktop_Testing_Project]]
* [homepage](http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/wiki/)
* latest upstream release (as of 2016-02-14) is 3.5, released mid-2013
* Debian Wheezy, Jessie and (as of 2016-02-14) Stretch have 2.3.1,
  released 2012-02-26
* [tutorial](http://download.freedesktop.org/ldtp/doc/ldtp-tutorial.pdf)
* The main bindings are Python, but there also are a Ruby client and
  Perl bindings in the [Git repo](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ldtp/ldtp2/tree/ldtp)
* The LDTP dev mailing-list is very quiet, and it's unclear whether
  GNOME still uses it, or instead switched to dogtail.

# Open questions

## Using accessibility technologies?

In some cases, it could simplify some testing steps, such as anything
about navigating menus, that we're currently mostly avoiding since
it's hard to do in a robust way with Sikuli.

A downside is that we're not exactly testing how most users interact
with the software. Some upsides are that it would ensure that our
stuff does support accessibility technologies, and that we would have
to maintain less pictures.
