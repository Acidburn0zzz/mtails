# Introduction

This is an on-going feasibility on how to port the Tails Installer to the Mac OS X operating system.

## Considerations

This feasibility study was done on a OS X El Capitan system on an early 2011 Macbook. Stock Python2.7 was used.

## Porting

liveusb-creator from Fedora(upstream) only works out of the box for Windows and Linux but no efforts were brought in to support OS X. This is an action point.

## Packaging

This section dives into packaging it all together.

### GTK bundling

* [GTK Mac Bundler ](https://github.com/twstrike/gtk-mac-bundler)
* [Micah Lee's attempt at GTK and Onionshare (he switched to QT)](https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/43)

### Codesigning

If we would ship the Tails Installer to OS X users. We'll have to codesign the resulting binary. This is an security feature, as considered by Apple. Users won't be able to run the Tails Installer, *unless*, they would disable this option and weakening security for their entire platform.
