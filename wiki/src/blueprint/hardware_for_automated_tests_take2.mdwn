Rationale
=========

In [[!tails_ticket 9264]], we're discussing and drafting our needs for more
isotesters. From some statistics of the number of automated builds per month,
we concluded we need to be able to run at least 1000 more test suites per
month, which means begin able to host at least 8 more isotesters.

Estimates
=========

As a reminder, we are discussing in [[!tails_ticket 10396]] that one
isotester means:

 * 20G RAM
 * 25G HDD (10G system+data, 15G tmp)
 * 3 CPU cores (+1 for the qemu process on the host)

So 8 isotesters would mean:

 * 160G RAM
 * 200G HDD
 * 32 CPU cores max

From there, it seems unlikely we could host that on Lizard, and we are
back on the research about new hardware for isotesters.

Hardware
========

Given the amount of RAM and CPUs required, it seems close to [[Lizard's
specs|blueprint/hardware_for_automated_tests]]. If we stick on the CPUs, we
probably need the same kind, with 12 cores and in the end 48 CPU threads.

If we settle on this, we would have a bit of room for the future to be able to
run up to 11 isotesters (44 CPUs, 275-330G HDD, 220G RAM), running theorically
1320 test suites per month on this sole box.

We still need to decide if we would use faster (as in Ghz) CPUs than the one
Lizard has (Low voltages versions). In this case the price jumps quite a bit,
and the electic bill will too (120W each for that kind of CPUs, against the 65W
each of Lizard's ones).

The following price estimations are based on interpromicro.com ones.

## Option A: Low voltage CPUs

That's essentially a Lizard clone, minus SSD HDDs.

 * 1 x Super X10DRi, 2x GB/i350 LAN, 10x SATA3(C612)+R, IPMI, DDR4(1TB)          - $390
 * 2 x Intel® E5-2650Lv3-1.8Ghz/12C, 30M, 9.6GT/s, 65W LGA2011 CPU               - $2,860
 * 16 x 16GB D4-2133Mhz, ECC/Reg 288-Pin Sdram                                   - $2100
 * 2 x Samsung 850 EVO, 500GB 2.5" SATA3 SSD(3D V-NAMD)                          - $400
 * 2 x Heatsinks                                                                 - $100
 * 1 x Supermicro SC113TQ-600W, 1U RM, WIO, 8x 2.5" SAS/SATA 600W                - $350

Total   --- **$6200**

## Option B: Faster CPUs

 * 1 x Super X10DRi, 2x GB/i350 LAN, 10x SATA3(C612)+R, IPMI, DDR4(1TB)          - $390
 * 2 x Intel® E5-2670v3-2.3Ghz/12C, 30M, 9.6GT/s, 120W LGA2011 CPU               - $3,300
 * 16 x 16GB D4-2133Mhz, ECC/Reg 288-Pin Sdram                                   - $2100
 * 2 x Samsung 850 EVO, 500GB 2.5" SATA3 SSD(3D V-NAMD)                          - $400
 * 2 x Heatsinks                                                                 - $100
 * 1 x Supermicro SC113TQ-600W, 1U RM, WIO, 8x 2.5" SAS/SATA 600W                - $350

Total   --- **$6650**
