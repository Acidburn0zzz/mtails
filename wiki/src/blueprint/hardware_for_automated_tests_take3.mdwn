# Rationale

In 2016 we gave our main server some more RAM, as a temporary solution
to cope with our workload, and as a way to learn about how to scale
it. See [[blueprint/hardware_for_automated_tests_take2]] for our
reasoning, lots of benchmark results, and conclusions.

It's working relatively well so far, but we may need to upgrade again
soonish, and improvements are always welcome in the contributor UX
area:

 * When Jenkins has built an ISO from one of our main branches or from
   a branch that is _Ready for QA_, since October 2017 we rebuild in
   in a slightly different build environment to ensure it can be
   [[rebuilt reproducibly|blueprint/reproducible_builds]].
   This increased substantially the number of ISO image we build
   which sometimes creates congestion in our CI pipeline (see below
   for details).
 * On our current setup, large numbers of automated test cases are
   brittle and had to be disabled on Jenkins (`@fragile`), which quite
   a few problematic consequences such as: it decreases the value our
   CI system brings to our development process, it is demotivating for
   test suite developers, it decreases the confidence developers have
   in our test suite, and it forces developers to run the full test
   suite elsewhere when they really want to validate a branch.
   Interestingly, we don't see this much brittleness anywhere else,
   even on a replica of our Jenkins setup that uses nested
   virtualization too.
 * As we add more automated tests, and re-enable tests previously
   flagged as fragile, a full test run takes longer and longer.
   We're now up to 160 minutes / run. We can't make it faster by
   adding RAM anymore nor by adding CPUs to ISO testers. But faster
   CPU cores would fix that: the same test suite only takes 105
   minutes on a replica of our Jenkins setup, also using nested
   virtualization, with a poor Internet connection but a faster CPU.
 * Building our website takes a long while (8 minutes on our ISO
   builders i.e. 17% of the entire ISO build time), which makes ISO
   builds take longer than they could. This will get worse as new
   languages are added to our website. This is a single-threaded task,
   so adding more CPU cores or RAM would not help: only faster CPU
   cores would fix that. For example, the ISO build only takes 30
   minutes (including 4.5 minutes for building the website) on
   a replica of our Jenkins setup, also using nested virtualization,
   with a poor Internet connection but faster CPU cores.
 * Waiting time in queue for ISO build and test jobs is acceptable
   most of the time, but too high during peak load periods: between
   2017-06-17 and 2017-12-17, 4% of the test jobs have to wait for
   more than 1 hour, and 1% more than 2 hours; similarly, 2% of the
   ISO build jobs had to wait more than 1 hour. That's not many jobs
   of course, but this congestion happens precisely when we need
   results from our CI infra ASAP, be it because there's intense
   ongoing development or because we're reviewing and merging lots of
   branches close to a code freeze, so these delays hurt our
   development and release process.
 * Our current server was purchased at the end of 2014. The hardware
   can last quite a few more years, but we should plan (at least
   budget-wise) for replacing it when it is 5 years old, at the end of
   2019, to the latest.
 * New candidate services are being considered, such as Piwik
   ([[!tails_ticket 14601]]) and self-hosting our website
   ([[!tails_ticket 14588]]). At least Piwik will require lots of
   resources and put quite some load on the system where we run it.
   Both need to be hosted on hardware we control, where we can do our
   best to guarantee our users' privacy. OTOH there's no
   security/privacy reason why our CI system has to be hosted on
   hardware we control.

# Options

## Replace lizard

Pros:

 * No initial development nor skills to learn: we can run our test
   suite in exactly the same way as we currently do.
 * On-going cost increases only slightly (we probably won't get
   low-voltage CPUs this time).
 * We can sell the current hardware while it's still current, and get
   some of our bucks back.

Cons:

 * High initial money investment.
 * Hard to tell whether this would fix our test suite fragility
   problems, and we'll only know after we've spent lots of money.
 * Hard to specify what hardware we need. If we get it wrong, likely
   we have to wait another 5 years before we try again.

## Dedicated ISO testing machine, no nested virtualization

Pros:

 * Fast.

Cons:

 * Medium to high initial money investment.
 * On-going cost for hosting 2 servers.
 * Hard to tell whether this would fix our test suite fragility
   problems, and we'll only know after we've spent lots of money.
 * If we run only tests there, then we don't improve ISO build
   performance. But if we do, then we might remain affected by test
   suite fragility problems.
 * Hard to specify what hardware we need. If we get it wrong, likely
   we have to wait another 5 years before we try again.
 * Non-negligible development costs and hard sysadmin problems to
   solve ([[!tails_ticket 9486]]):
   - We currently _reboot_ isotesters between test suite runs ⇒ if we
     go this way we need to learn how to clean up after various kinds
     of test suite failure.
   - Our test suite currently assumes only one instance is running on
     a given system ⇒ if we go this way we have to remove
     this limitation.

## Dedicated ISO testing machine, with nested virtualization

Pros:

 * No initial development nor skills to learn: we can run our test
   suite in exactly the same way as we currently do.

Cons:

 * Medium to high initial money investment.
 * On-going cost for hosting 2 servers.
 * Hard to tell whether this would fix our test suite fragility
   problems, and we'll only know after we've spent lots of money.
 * If we run only tests there, then we don't improve ISO build
   performance. But if we do, then we might remain affected by test
   suite fragility problems.
 * Hard to specify what hardware we need. If we get it wrong, likely
   we have to wait another 5 years before we try again.

## Run builds and/or tests in the cloud

EC2 does not support running KVM inside their VMs yet. Both Azure and
Google Cloud support it. OpenStack supports it too as long as the
cloud is run on KVM (e.g.
[OVH Public Cloud](https://www.openstack.org/marketplace/public-clouds/ovh-group/ovh-public-cloud/),
and maybe later
[OSU Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org/services/hosting/details/)).

There's a Jenkins plugin for every major cloud provider that allows
starting instances on demand when needed, up to pre-defined limits,
and shuts them down after a configurable idle time.

After building an ISO, we copy artifacts from the ISO builder to the
Jenkins master (and thus to nightly.t.b.o), and then from the Jenkins
master to another ISO builder (if the branch is _Ready for QA_ or one
of our main branches) and one ISO tester (in an case) that run
downstream jobs. These copies are blocking operations in our feedback
loop. So:

- If the network connection between pieces of our CI system was
  too slow, the performance benefits of building and testing
  faster may vanish.

  Assuming a 1.2 GB ISO, 3.5 minutes should be enough for a copy
  (based on benchmarking a download of a Debian ISO image from lizard)
  ⇒ 2 or 3 × 3.5 = 8 or 10.5 minutes for an ISO build; compared to 1.5
  minutes to the Jenkins master + 20 seconds to the 2nd ISO builder +
  15 seconds to the ISO tester =~ 2 minutes on lizard currently.
  In the worst case (Jenkins master on our infrastructure, Jenkins
  workers in the cloud) it adds 5 or 8.5 minutes to the feedback loop,
  which is certainly not negligible but is not a deal breaker either.

- If data transfers between pieces of our CI system costed money we
  would need estimate how much these copies would cost. On OVH Public
  Cloud, data transfers to/from the Internet are included in the price
  of the instance so let's ignore this.

One way to avoid this problem entirely is to run our Jenkins master
and nightly.t.b.o in the cloud as well.

Pros:

 * Scalable as much as we can (afford), both to react to varying
   workloads on the short term (some days we build and test tons of
   ISO images, some days a lot fewer), and to adjust to changing needs
   on the long term.
 * No initial money investment.
 * No hardware failures we have to deal with.
 * We can try various instances types until we find the right one, as
   opposed to bare metal that requires careful planning and
   somewhat-informed guesses (mistakes in this area can only be fixed
   years later: for example, choosing low-voltage CPUs, that are
   suboptimal for our workload).
 * Frees lots of resources on our current virtualization host, that
   can be reused for other purposes. And if we don't need these
   resources, then our next bare metal server can be much cheaper,
   both in terms of initial investment and on-going costs (it will
   suck less power).

Cons:

 * We need to learn how to manage systems in the cloud, how to deal
   with billing, and how to control these systems from Jenkins.

 * On-going cost: renting resources costs money every month.

   Very rough estimate, assuming we run all ISO builds and tests on
   dynamic OVH `C2-15` instances (4 vCores at 3.1 GHz, 15 GB RAM, 100
   GB SSD), assuming they perform exactly like my local Jenkins (4
   i7-6770HQ vCores at 2.60GHz, 15 GB RAM), and assuming that no VAT
   applies:

    - builds & tests:
      (30 minutes/build * 450 builds/month + 105 minutes/test * 350 tests/month)
      / 60 * 0.173€ = 145€/month
    - second build for reproducibility ([[!tails_ticket 13436]]):
      30 minutes / 60 * 250 builds/month * 0.173€ =  22€/month
    - total = 167€/month

   Now, to be more accurate:

    - Likely these instances will be faster than my local Jenkins,
      thanks to higher CPU clock rate, which should lower the actual
      costs; but only actual testing will give us more
      precise numbers.

    - Running a well chosen number of static instances would probably
      lower these costs thanks to the discount when paying per month.
      Also, booting a dynamic instance and configuring it takes some
      additional time, which costs money and decreases performance.

      We need to evaluate how many static instances (kept running at
      all times and paid per-month) we run and how many dynamic
      instances (spawned on demand and pay per-hour) we allow. E.g.
      on OVH public cloud, a dynamic C2-15 instance costs more than
      a static one once it runs more than 50% of the time. Thanks to
      the _Cluster Statistics_ Jenkins plugin, once we run this in the
      cloud we'll have the data we need to optimize this; it should be
      easy to script it so we can update these settings from time
      to time.

    - We need to add the cost of hosting our Jenkins master and
      nightly.t.b.o in the same cloud, or the cost of transferring
      build artifacts between that cloud and lizard.

      Our Jenkins master is currently allocated 2.6 GB of RAM and
      2 vcpus. An OVH S1-8 (13€/month) or B2-7 (22€/month) static
      instance should be enough. We estimated that 300 GB of storage
      would be enough at least until the end of 2018. Our metrics say
      that the storage volume that hosts Jenkins artifacts often makes
      good use of 1000-2000 IOPS, so an OVH "High Speed Volume"
      (0.08€/month/GB) would be better suited even though in practice
      only a small part of these 300 GB needs to be that fast, and
      possibly a slower "Classic Volume" might perform well enough.
      So:

       * worst case: 22 + 300×0.08 = 46€/month
       * best case: 13 + 300×0.04 = 25€/month

    - In theory we could keep running _some_ of our builds on our own
      infra instead of in the cloud: one option is that the cloud
      would only be used during peak load times for builds (but always
      used for tests in order to fix our test suite brittleness
      problems, hopefully). But if we do that, we don't improve ISO
      build performance in most cases, and the build artifacts copy
      problems surface, which costs performance and some development
      time to optimize things a bit:

       * If we run the Jenkins master on our own infra: only artifacts
         of ISO builds run in the cloud during peak load times need to
         be downloaded to lizard; we could force the 2nd ISO build to
         run locally so we avoid having to upload these artifacts to
         the cloud, or we could optimize the 2nd ISO build job to
         retrieve the 1st ISO only when the 2 ISOs differ and we need
         to run diffoscope on them (in which case we also need to
         download the 2nd ISO to archive it on the Jenkins master).
         But all ISO build artifacts must be uploaded to the nodes
         that run the test suite in the cloud.

       * If we run the Jenkins master in the cloud: most of the time
         we need to upload there the ISOs built on lizard; then we
         need to download them again for the 2nd build on lizard as
         well (unless we do something clever to keep them around for
         the 2nd build, or force the 2nd build to run in the cloud
         too); but at this point they're already available out there
         in the cloud for the test suite downstream job. During peak
         times, the difference is that ISOs built in the cloud are
         already there for everything else that follows (assuming we
         force the 2nd build to run in the cloud too).

 * We need to trust a third-party somewhat.

 * To make the whole thing more flexible and easier to manage, it
   would be good to have the same nodes able to run both builds and
   tests. Not sure what it would take and what the consequences
   would be.

We could request a grant from the cloud provider to experiment with
this approach.
