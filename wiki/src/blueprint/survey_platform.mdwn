[[!meta title="Survey platform"]]

Requirements
============

- MUST
  - Be non-commercial, open source, and privacy respectful

- SHOULD
  - Be possible to integrate in ikiwiki (to avoid people having to go elsewhere to answer questions)

- Captchas: How do we prevent spam on the survey platform, both from
  robots and humans.
  - Captcha can deal with robots.
  - Attention check questions can deal with humans.
  - How can we get both without being annoying? Maybe having no captcha
    and two attention check questions could be useful but then that's
    maybe a bit annoying for humans.
