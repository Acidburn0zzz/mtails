[[!meta title="Survey platform"]]

<a id="platform-requirements"></a>

Requirements
============

- MUST
  - Be open source and privacy respectful

- SHOULD
  - Be possible to integrate in ikiwiki (to avoid people having to go elsewhere to answer questions)

- Captchas: How do we prevent spam on the survey platform, both from
  robots and humans.
  - Captcha can deal with robots.
  - Attention check questions can deal with humans.
  - How can we get both without being annoying? Maybe having no captcha
    and two attention check questions could be useful but then that's
    maybe a bit annoying for humans.

LimeSurvey
==========

- <https://www.limesurvey.org/>
- PHP + MySQL
- Demo site: <https://demo.limesurvey.org/>
- Features: Very complete.
- Embedding: Works in an iframe but the template would need some
  adjustment.
- Captcha: You can add a captcha *before* accessing the survey. I
  couldn't find how to add a captcha right before submitting.
- Versions and packaging: Daily "stable" releases in ZIP files. LTS and
  "one-click" auto-upgrade for pay.

### Requirements

- Hardware
  - CPU
    - My prototype machine uses very little of its Core 2 Duo CPU P8700 @ 2.53GHz.
      So I guess that 1 core of whatever you have will do.
  - RAM
    - My prototype machine uses 256MB when LimeSurvey is hit on various tabs.
      So I guess it should still work with 512MB.
  - Storage
    - The install directory takes 300MB (.git included).
    - I don't know how much the database will take but it shouldn't be crazy, let's say 100MB.
    - So I should do with 2-5GB on top of what you need for the base system and the backups.
- Software infrastructure
  - Web server
    - PHP 5.1.2 or later
      - Packages: php php-mysql php-mbstring php-xml
    - HTTPS
      - I'd like https://survey.tails.boum.org/ and some HTTPS on top of it.
    - I didn't have to edit the VHost on my prototype machine.
    - Being able to restart the web server might be useful.
  - Database
    - 1 empty MySQL or MariaDB database 4.1.0 or later.
    - 1 user with full access to this database on the command line (mysql and mysqldump). I used:
      - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON piwik.* TO 'piwik'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'superfatpassword';`
    - 1 password to access the database.
  - Backups
    - Backups of /var/www/ and the database.
    - Be able to trigger a backup before the update and be able to restore it
      if it fails. I can also do that myself using rsync and mysqldump.
  - Monitoring
    - I can create a test survey and you could monitor that
      https://survey.tails.boum.org/index.php/$SURVEYID returns 2xx.
    - What do you usually do to monitor web applications?
  - Email
    - Be able to send emails to the outside world; though I might not send any as a start.
- Credentials
  - You have my SSH key already.
  - Usual stuff
    - bash, cat, cd, chown, cp, diff, file, find, grep, head, less, ls, man, mkdir, mv, ps, rm, rmdir, tail, top
  - Stuff I like
    - ncdu, screen, vi
  - Stuff I might need to do the manual upgrade, download plugins, etc.
    - git, gunzip, tar, unzip, wget, mysql, mysqldump, rsync
  - Otherwise in which forms do you need to know the credentials?
