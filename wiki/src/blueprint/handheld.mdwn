Left to do
==========

Generic
-------

* Minimized applications in the taskbar can't be raised via the
  taskbar. They can be raised via the *Activities Overwiew*.

Toshiba Encore 2
----------------

feature/jessie + 32-bit UEFI, 20150507:

* The Florence virtual keyboard is not very usable:
  - its default font size is way too small, but that can be configured
  - its "systray" icon is too small to be clicked, so one can't toggle
    the virtual keyboard on/off; see [[!tails_ticket 8312]]
* Wi-Fi... but perhaps that's because airplane mode was enabled in
  Windows.
* Battery level monitoring: GNOME Shell always says 100%.
* Backlight tuning: GNOME Shell offers the UI, but it has no effect
  that I can perceive.
* Tor Browser 4.5 [[!tor_bug 15953 desc="does a weird resizing dance on startup"]].
* Sound card not detected (`/proc/asound/cards`), although a bunch of
  `snd_soc_*` kernel modules are loaded

Works fine
