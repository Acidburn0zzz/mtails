Camping

### Tails as a tent

From "[Writing good documentation](https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/426)" at the IFF 2018

- [Drawing of an unfolded tent] portable, set up anywhere in the world or your own backyard
- [Drawing of two similar tents]
- [Drawing of a tent in a bag] small portable tent fits in backpack, with your belongings.
- [Drawing of a tent city of similar tents]

- Amnesic
  - Empty every time its setup
  - Stored in backpack ("USB stick") along with "stuff" which can be
    moved into the tent ("persistence") or not.
- Incognito
  - Can move around (change "address")
  - Many tents look alike
  - Works best among other tents (not in a library)
- Live
  - Can carry around in backpack
  - Can set up in backyard (own laptop) or away from home
- Put it away when its finished

"[Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/)" is an organization and a code of ethics
for outdoor activities.

Open relationship
-----------------

Tails is not my main operating system: Tails does not make me choose
between itself and other operating systems. With Tails I have an open
relationship. Is not my main operating system, I have other operating
systems for other things.

One in my laptop, one in my school...

Tails is not jealous and does not aim to fulfill all my computer needs:
if I need something Tails cannot give me... I can use another operating
system!

But I respect our relationship: Tails does not want to be plugged to my
laptop if I am running other operating systems, so I never do that.

And I don't use identities I use on other operating systems from the
same Tails USB stick.
