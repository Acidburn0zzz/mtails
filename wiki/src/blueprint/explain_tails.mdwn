Redmine view
============

You need the "Worker" role:

Home
====

- On the home page's top bar, "How Tails works" is pre-selected and
  not clickable, so the only way to get to the about page — that
  actually explains how Tails works — is to click the aforementioned
  "How Tails works" button further below down the page.
  Is this on purpose?

  * This is a known issue of the prototype. Will be fixed.

- the search button, IMO, should stay in the purple part. It moves
  according to the width of the windows and doesn't look great when it's
  too far on the side.

- The search box is floating in a weird place and moves around
  to even weirder places depending when I zoom in/out.

- the search bar goes out of the purple part in my computer (I have
  slightly increased font size)

- in the first image, the notebook, is not present a USB stick (!?)

- versione di tails in home

- colors should be consistent in the bar menu as in the home page as in
  the donation page. indeed, in the donation page, the buttons for
  donating are dark green for selection and light green for un-selection.
  maybe use the same palette?

- I find the "Donate" button too aggressively contrasted with the
  rest of the page. It's an important button but still, I don't feel
  super comfortable with making it the most eye-catchy button on our
  home page. Were the rest of the top bar less dark (for example),
  this button would jump at me less aggressively.

  I also think the yellow Donate is a bit aggressive. It's nice to make
  it stand out, but a bit less flashy would be nice.

  * It can be easily fixed with a pale tone
  * Underline in yellow instead of yellow background

- I also didn't realize the "How tails works" was a link and not the
  headers of the section under it. Maybe saying "Learn more about how
  Tails work ? " or something like that would make it clearer?

- I find the green background of the top bar too "heavy"
  and dark, compared to the rest of the page that is more "breathy"
  (sorry, I lack vocabulary in this area).

- I think the green on the top bar is too dark. The color
under "How Tails works" seems less aggressive.

- I also think the green of the navigation menu on the top is too dark.
  I think it would work better having the darker version being the current
  page, instead of the opposite.

- <strike>"The huge diversity of people and organizations running Tor relays
  make it more secure and more sustainable." ? s/make/makes/ ?</strike> [WONT]

- It took me some time to understand that "How Tails works"
  was a link and not the heading for the following section.

  I understand the rounded corners should hint me towards thinking
  "it's a button", but it's the only time on the home page that this
  exact style is used to convey this meaning: previous links are
  styled in a more traditional web manner (text, feedback on hover,
  rectangle container). It seems to me that this button is basically
  adding a tiny pinch of "touch mobile app" design paradigm in the
  middle of a website based on other design paradigms, hence my
  initial confusion. Giving visual feedback when hover'ing this
  button would help a bit (on non-touch devices) but this does not
  feel sufficient to me and I'm sure you can find a better
  solution

- The concepts of the images are finalized but they lack color and style
  Do you mean the final images will have colors?
  FWIW, I like the levels-of-gray ones, but maybe I'll like the
  colorized version even more

- <strike>JOBS might be included within the CONTRIBUTE page (how many jobs did
  you publish in the last 10 years? :)</strike> [DONE]

  * Out-of-scope for this project.

- "Tails is a portable operating system that protects your privacy and
  helps you avoid censorship." -> maybe put "Tails" in bold (wikipedia
  convention, I think it would not be surprising for readers) ?

- Same sentence... maybe it's too much, but I'd put "privacy" in green
  and "avoid censorship" in purple.

- We don't have the "news" preview in the /home page anymore. Maybe not
  a problem, but it's clear we'll lose some readers of those... should the
  browser open on the /news page instead?

- I like the pictures a lot, I'm eager to see the colorized versions,
  but I agree too that the B&W versions already work.

- The "Who uses Tails" pictures are either too small, or too detailed -
  they don't come out very good on my (middle size) screen). The
  journalist's mouth seems really mean and angry, should probably modify
  that?

- Snowden's picture at the bottom looks badly cropped, is there a way to
  get a better one ?

- Should Tor, riseup, EFF, etc be links ?

- I agree too that the "How Tails works" links doesn't work. Maybe move
  it below "who uses Tails"? Or just remove the link, it's already at the
  top of the pages for those who want details.

- I don't like the different of style between images of personas and
  illustrations.  And I think probably not so important in homepage. and could be feel as
  exclusion for other kinds of persona. And add "You", is not a solution.

### On a smartphone

- The search box is on top of the logo (as in it hides it).

- I have to zoom out to see the full pictures

- and they are a bit larger than the text part, which initially takes
  the whole width of the screen (before I zoom out).

- There's a weird dark purple block between the logo and the top bar;
  I don't understand what it's for.

- The top bar occupies 3 full lines.

- All this combined, as a result there's almost no actual
  content above the fold, while I would hope to see "Tails is
  a portable operating system that protects your privacy and avoids
  censorship" there.

- The images on the home page don't entirely fit: I have to scroll to
  the right to see the missing bits, where they overlap with the
  stripped background instead of the main white body background,
  which feels unpolished.

About
=====

- I find the illustrations about how tails works very nice and
  effective. However, the characters are incredibly heteronormative (the
  feminine girl with long eyelashes, the hipster boy with manly beard...),
  and here we're making a strong assumption about us as a community and
  our perspective users. Which I find very problematic, politically
  speaking.

- big margin between paragraphs

- "can be installed on any USB stick of 8 GB" -> not "any", so let's say
  "on an USB stick" ?

- "Online trackers and advertisers won't be able to follow you around
  from one site to another anymore." site -> website, like the previous
  paragraph ?

- "it cannot be related to you." -> is this the right word? Not a
  native, but sounds weird to me... ask a native ?

### On a smartphone

- On the about page, images are ordered a bit weirdly compared to
  text: I see a sequence of N × "2 text sections, followed by
  2 images".

- The paragraph is nice have:

  - A) title -img - text
  - or
  - B) img- title - text
  - Not mixed.
