Leave no trace on the computer
==============================

Your secure computer anywhere
-----------------------------

Tails is installed on a USB stick that you can run on any computer
instead of Windows or macOS. You can temporarily **turn you own computer
into a secure machine** without modifying it or **stay safe while using
someone else's computer**.

<!-- PIC: Tails is like a tent. You can carry it with you and use it
anywhere! -->

Amnesia
-------

Tails always starts from the same clean state and **everything you did
disappears** automatically when you shut down Tails. You don't have to
worry about the viruses on your Windows or about getting your Tails
infected.

<!-- PIC: Like a tent, Tails starts empty every time and leaves no trace
when you shut it down. -->

<!-- MORE: Tails is configured with special care to not use the
computer's hard-disks, even if there is some swap space on them. The
only storage space used by Tails is in RAM, which is automatically
erased when the computer shuts down. So you won't leave any trace on the
computer either of the Tails system itself or what you used it for.
That's why we call Tails "amnesic". -->

Encrypted persistence
---------------------

You can choose to **save some of your files and configuration** in an
encrypted Persistence, protected by a password. You can store in
Persistence your working documents, your browser bookmarks, your emails,
and even some additional software.

<!-- PIC: You can carry your personal things in your secure backpack and
set them up if your tent if you want to. -->

Digital security toolbox
-------------------------

Tails includes many applications to **work on sensitive documents and
communicate securely**. All the applications included in Tails work
out-of-the-box and are configured with safe defaults to **prevent you
from doing mistakes**.

<!-- PIC: Camping gear -->

<!-- MORE:
Tails also comes with a selection of tools to protect your data using strong
encryption:

  - [[Encrypt your USB sticks or external
    hard-disks|doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]] using <span
    class="definition">[[!wikipedia Linux_Unified_Key_Setup desc="LUKS"]]</span>,
    the Linux standard for disk-encryption.

  - Automatically use HTTPS to encrypt all your communications to a number of
    major websites using [HTTPS
    Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), a Firefox extension
    developed by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org).

  - Encrypt and sign your emails and documents using the *de facto* standard
    <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP desc="OpenPGP"]]</span>
    either from Tails email client, text editor or file browser.

  - Protect your instant messaging conversations using <span
    class="definition">[[!wikipedia Off-the-Record_Messaging
    desc="OTR"]]</span>, a cryptographic tool that provides encryption,
    authentication and deniability.

  - [[Securely delete your files|doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]]
    and clean your diskspace using [[Nautilus
    Wipe|http://wipetools.tuxfamily.org/nautilus-wipe.html]].

[[Read more about those tools in the documentation.|doc/encryption_and_privacy]]

Leave no trace on the Internet
==============================

Everything through Tor
----------------------

Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor
network. Tor secures your connection with **3 layers of encryption** and
passes it through **3 servers around the world** operated by volunteers.

<!-- PIC: Map with secret path -->

<!-- XXX: 
  - all software is configured to connect to the Internet through Tor
  - if an application tries to connect to the Internet directly, the
    connection is automatically blocked for security.
-->

Avoid online surveillance and censorship
----------------------------------------

Tor prevents someone watching your Internet connection from learning
**<em>what</em> you are doing on the Internet**. You can avoid
censorship because it is **impossible for a censor to know** which sites
you are visiting.

Change identity and avoid tracking
----------------------------------

Tor also prevents the websites that you are visiting from learning
**<em>where</em> and <em>who</em> you are**, unless you tell them. You
can visit websites **anonymously or change your identity**. Online
trackers won't be able to follow you around from one site to another
anymore.

Software for freedom
====================

Security that comes for free
----------------------------

Because nobody should have to pay to be safe while using a computer, we
are giving out Tails for free and try to make it easy to use by anybody.
We are a nonprofit and diverse community. Our work is funded by
donations from people like you and organizations that support Internet
freedom.

Transparency to build trust
---------------------------

Our work and all the code of our software is public so that you don't
have to trust us blindly. Independent security researchers can verify
that Tails really works the way it should.

Sharing
-------

Tails stands on the shoulders of giants. Tails is based on the Tor
network, the Debian operating system, and the GNOME desktop environment.
We share back our improvements with these projects and others whenever
possible so that many more people can benefit from our work.
