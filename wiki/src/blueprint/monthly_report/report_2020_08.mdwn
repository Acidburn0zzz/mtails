Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ((emergency release)?).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

- Changed massively our instructions on how to start Tails:

  1. Documented [[Shift + Restart on Windows|install/win/usb#start-tails]]. ([[!tails_ticket 16456]])

     We're not telling Windows users to use the Boot Menu key anymore.

     It's still the default for [[Linux|install/linux#start-tails]].

  2. Wrote dedicated pages for starting Tails on [[PC|doc/first_steps/start/pc]] and
     [[Mac|doc/first_steps/start/mac]].

  3. Simplified troubleshooting sections.

     We simplified and made consistent the [[troubleshooting instructions|install/win/usb#troubleshooting]]
     in all installation scenarios.

  4. Removed instructions to report to Help Desk from the installation
     scenarios but kept them on [[doc/first_steps/start|doc/first_steps/start/pc/#help-desk]].

  We believe that all these changes will lower your workload and make
  more people start Tails at the same time.

- Rephrased our [[FAQ about VPN|support/faq#vpn]]. ([[!tails_ticket 15783]])

- Wrote an [[FAQ about 32-bit computers|support/faq#32-bit]]. ([[!tails_ticket 17866]])

- Fixed all outdated links to torproject.org. ([[!tails_ticket 17717]])

- Used ikiwiki's automatic referencing of HTML ids in table of content
  on the pages that have the longest tables of content. ([[!tails_ticket 17844]])

  Now you can copy links directly from the table of content to point to:

User experience
===============

- Analyzed the responses of the [[OpenPGP and Pidgin survey|blueprint/user_survey#openpgp-pidgin]]. ([[!tails_ticket 17821]])

  It's pretty exciting because we barely have quantitative data about
  our user base at large.

  Highlights:

  * Our users find Tails relatively easy to use compared to an industry
    average.

  * Linux users are still the biggest share of the respondents and this
    hasn't changed much since 2017.

  * The top 5 wishes of our users are, in rough order:

    1. Do nothing because Tails is great already :)

    2. More persistent settings: security level in Tor Browser,
       background, keyboard, and language

    3. Messaging applications and voice calls

    4. Make Tor less painful for web browsing

    5. Better upgrades

  * OpenPGP is much more popular outside Thunderbird: 49% vs. 16%.

  * Enigmail users are more technical than OpenPGP users overall.

  * Electrum (28%) is more used than Thunderbird (27%), which is more used than XMPP (17%).

  * IRC is used by a non-negligible 8% of respondents.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

This last month we felt that the social crisis created by covid is starting
to take a toll on our users mental state, and we received
more derailed emails than usual. Hopefully there are local resources you
can count on for this difficult times. Take care!

1. Many users wrote to us with problems related to MacbookPros from 2020.
   Apple in general does not prioritize collaborating with Free Software
   projects, and their newest hardware is usually very hard for Free Software
   developers to get working with Linux, and thus Tails. In comparison, 
   hardware for PC tends to be more open and get support for Linux faster.
   Please take that into consideration if you are buying hardware to run Tails.

1. The last release also saw some users with graphics cards issues. Please
   read [[the page shown on the error message|https://tails.boum.org/gdm]]
   before mailing us, because there might be a solution for your graphics card.

1. Some users had problems to do automatic upgrades to Tails 4.10. We are
   looking onto [[!tails_ticket 17908 desc="this problem"]].
