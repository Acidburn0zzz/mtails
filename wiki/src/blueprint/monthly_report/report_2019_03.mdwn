Code

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

  implementing the agreement we've reached ([[!tails_ticket 15807]],
  [[!tails_ticket 16094]], [[!tails_ticket 9956]]).

  automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 16603]]).

  major release and its implications for Tails.

  Debian and Ubuntu.
