Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|bugfix|emergency] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We agreed on a list of languages that we want to support
  out-of-the-box in Tails and started implementing it. The [[*Additional
  Software*|doc/first_steps/additional_software]] feature will make it possible
  for other users to add their favorite dictionaries and language packs while
  making our USB image a bit smaller for everybody. ([[!tails_ticket 15807]],
  [[!tails_ticket 16095]], [[!tails_ticket 9956]])

- We identified another possible cause for partially applied
  automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 16603]]).

- We coordinated with the Tor Browser team wrt. their upcoming 8.5
  major release and its implications for Tails.

- We continued to carry out our plans to deprecate tails-installer from
  Debian and Ubuntu.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We improved how installation and upgrade instructions are linked from
  our release notes and download pages. ([[!tails_ticket 16470]])

- We documented [[how to run Tails from a USB image in
  `virt-manager`|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager#usb_image]],
  which is the only virtualization solution that allows you to use a
  persistent volume in a virtual machine.

User experience
===============

- We drafted how to explain Tails in a new
  [[homepage|blueprint/explain_tails/homepage]] and [[about
  page|blueprint/explain_tails/about]] and tested it with 5 people with
  the help from [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/).
  ([[!tails_ticket 16536]])

- We analyzed the [success metrics of *Additional Software* and the
  integration of
  *VeraCrypt*](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190326.173900.138d9b45.en.html):

  - Both features probably participated in getting our boot stats to
    increase again (20% more since September 2019).
  - Both features didn't change much the tech-savviness of our user
    base.
  - The people who use *VeraCrypt* in Tails almost doubled.

  Results are good but we expected more. We need to improve how we let
  the world know about new features.

- We analyzed the [success metrics for USB
  images](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190331.183400.d3d2350c.en.html):

  - The percentage of people using Tails from macOS at least doubled
    since 3.12.
  - USB images account for 76% of our downloads and our download buttons
    are hit 3970 times a day on average.

- We created a new version of our logo that can be used
  with or without tagline. ([[!tails_ticket 14835]])

  [[!img contribute/how/promote/material/logo/tails-logo-flat.svg link="no" size="300x"]] [[!img contribute/how/promote/material/logo/tails-logo-flat-notagline.svg link="no" size="300x"]]

- We documented *Kazam* instead of *recordMyDesktop* to [[record
  screencasts when doing usability
  testing|contribute/how/user_experience/recording#screencast]] because
  it is more reliable.
