Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.0 was released on June 13|news/version_3.0]] (major release).

* Tails 3.1 is [[scheduled for August 8|contribute/calendar]].

Tails 3.0 is the first version of Tails based on Debian 9 (Stretch).
It brings a completely new startup and shutdown experience, a lot of
polishing to the desktop, security improvements in depth, and major
upgrades to a lot of the included software. We cannot list all the
improvements it brings here (see the
[[announcement|news/version_3.0]]), but let's still highlight a few
major changes:

- *Tails Greeter*, the application to configure Tails at startup, has
  been completely redesigned for ease of use:
- The shutdown experience has also been redesigned in order to be
  more reliable and more discrete.
- Tails 3.0 works on <span
  class="definition">[[!wikipedia x86-64 desc="64-bit computers"]]</span>
  only and not on 32-bit computers anymore.

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

We've made great progress on simplifying the Tails Installer user interface. [[!tails_ticket 8859]]

## Reproducible Builds

We are still working on making Tails ISO images build reproducibly.
We've seen some images build in such a deterministic manner in March and 
even during a testing session. However, in some build environments it
does not work reliably yet and some new issues have manifested
themselves which need to be fixed until we can claim that our ISO 
images are really reproducible, such as
[[!tails_ticket 12641 desc="Comment changes in POT files make ISO non reproducible"]].

Furthermore, we are still working on documenting the new release process and 
verification options for our users.

Documentation and website
=========================

XXX: Explore the Git history:

         git log --patch --since='1 October' --until='1 November' origin/master -- "*.*m*"

User experience
===============

XXX: Check the archives of tails-ux: https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/

Infrastructure
==============

## HTTP mirror pool

We've switched our mirror pool to mirrors serving files over HTTPS
only ([[!tails_ticket 12837]]). Our round-robin fallback DNS
pool is still serving files over HTTP, and we are currently thinking
about how to switch those to HTTPS too ([[!tails_ticket 12833]]).

## Reproducible builds

Remaining issues on our CI infrastructure include:

* [[!tails_ticket 12618]] Retrieving ISO build artifacts sometimes fails
  on Jenkins
* [[!tails_ticket 12574]] isobuilders system_disks check keeps switching
  between OK and WARNING since the switch to Vagrant

Funding
=======

XXX: The fundraising team should look at the fundraising Git.

       git log --patch --since='1 December' --until='1 January' origin/master

XXX: The fundraising and accounting teams should look at the archives of <tails-fundraising@boum.org> and <tails-accounting@boum.org>.

We've created a page listing our partners, previous and current [[grants, private companies and individuals who help keep Tails alive|partners/]] by supporting us financially. [[Do you want to partner with us too?|partners/become/]]
