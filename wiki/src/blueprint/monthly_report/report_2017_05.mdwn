Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

## Reproducible builds

In March we [[reported|news/report_2017_03]] that we had finally seen
an ISO image build reproducibly on several machines. Since then we
kept working on this front:

 * XXX: u.
 * See the [[Infrastructure section|report_2017_05#infrastructure]]
   for our work on other aspects of this project.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We have published the [[Tails Social contract|contribute/working_together/social_contract]].

- We finished updating all our documentation to Tails 3.0, based on
  Debian Stretch.

- We updated our documentation to a new layout of the *Universal USB
  Installer* for Windows and scaled its screenshots to fix an issue
  reported by [[!tails_ticket 11527 desc="huertanix"]].

User experience
===============

- We started experimenting with *Piwik* to do web analytics.

- We continued redesigning the [main window of *Tails
  Installer*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-May/003374.html).

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

## Reproducible builds

XXX: intrigeri

After a long discussion, we [[!tails_ticket 12409 desc="decided"]] not
to publish any Vagrant basebox at all: the key argument in favour of
this major design change was to remove one huge binary blob from the
list of trusted inputs needed for building a Tails ISO image.
This will substantially increase the value of Tails ISO images
building reproducibly. This decision has a few nice side effects,
including:

 * the properties of the basebox required to build a given state of our
   code base are entirely encoded in the corresponding Git commit;
 * changes in the ISO build box definition don't require building and
   uploading a new basebox.

Then we made enough progress to migrate our Continuous Integration
platform to the build system used by developers. This is now running
in production, not exactly smoothly yet (as explained below), but well
enough to keep supporting our development and quality assurance
processes. For details, see [[!tails_ticket 11972]],
[[!tails_ticket 11979]], [[!tails_ticket 11980]],
[[!tails_ticket 11981]], [[!tails_ticket 12017]], and
[[!tails_ticket 11006]].

Then we had to deal with a number of issues that we were not in
a position to identify before submitting this brand new system to
a real-world workload. Some are fixed already
([[!tails_ticket 12530]], [[!tails_ticket 12578]],
[[!tails_ticket 12565]], [[!tails_ticket 12541]],
[[!tails_ticket 12529]], [[!tails_ticket 12575]],
[[!tails_ticket 12606]]). Work is still in progress on some other
problems: they are our Continuous Integration engineers' top priority,
and should be fully resolved in the next couple of months.

Finally, we have [[!tails_ticket 12579 desc="set up"]] automated tests for
the reproducibility of our ISO image. Obviously, the results of these
tests
[are publicly available](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/reproducibly_build_Tails_ISO_testing/builds/).

Funding
=======

XXX: The fundraising team should look at the fundraising Git.

       git log --patch --since='1 December' --until='1 January' origin/master

XXX: The fundraising and accounting teams should look at the archives of <tails-fundraising@boum.org> and <tails-accounting@boum.org>.

- We are still in the process of discussing our proposal with OTF, and
  reworking it accordingly.

- We started migrating our European fiscal sponsor from Zwiebelfreunde
  to [CCT, the Center for the Cultivation of Technology](https://techcultivation.org/).

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

* gagz and geb did a presentation and a workshop of Tails at the [CPML](http://medias-libres.org) yearly meeting.

Press and testimonials
======================

XXX: Copy content from press/media_appearances_2016.mdwn
     This page is continuously updated by tails-press@boum.org, so if
     it's empty there might be nothing special to report.

Translation
===========

XXX: Add the output of `contribute/l10n_tricks/language_statistics.sh`
XXX: Add the output of (adjust month!):

    git checkout $(git rev-list -n 1 --before="September 1" origin/master) && \
    git submodule update --init && \
    ./wiki/src/contribute/l10n_tricks/language_statistics.sh

Metrics
=======

* Tails has been started more than BOOTS/MONTH times this month. This makes BOOTS/DAY boots a day on average.
* SIGS downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO from our website.
* 110 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

XXX: Ask tails@boum.org for these numbers.
