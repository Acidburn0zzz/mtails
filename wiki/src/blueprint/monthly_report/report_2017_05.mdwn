Documentation and website
=========================

- We have published the [[Tails Social contract|contribute/working_together/social_contract]].

- We finished updating all our documentation to Tails 3.0, based on
  Debian Stretch.

- We updated our documentation to a new layout of the *Universal USB
  Installer* for Windows and scaled its screenshots to fix an issue
  reported by [[!tails_ticket 11527 desc="huertanix"]].

User experience
===============

- We started experimenting with *Piwik* to do web analytics.

- We continued redesigning the [main window of *Tails
  Installer*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-May/003374.html).

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

Funding
=======

XXX: The fundraising team should look at the fundraising Git.

       git log --patch --since='1 December' --until='1 January' origin/master

XXX: The fundraising and accounting teams should look at the archives of <tails-fundraising@boum.org> and <tails-accounting@boum.org>.

- We are still in the process of discussing our proposal with OTF, and
  reworking it accordingly.
