Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

## Reproducible builds

In March we [[reported|news/report_2017_03]] that we had finally seen
an ISO image build reproducibly on several machines. Since then we
kept working on this front:

 * XXX: u.
 * See the [[Infrastructure section|report_2017_05#infrastructure]]
   for our work on other aspects of this project.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We have published the [[Tails Social contract|contribute/working_together/social_contract]].

- We finished updating all our documentation to Tails 3.0, based on
  Debian Stretch.

- We updated our documentation to a new layout of the *Universal USB
  Installer* for Windows and scaled its screenshots to fix an issue
  reported by [[!tails_ticket 11527 desc="huertanix"]].

User experience
===============

- We started experimenting with *Piwik* to do web analytics.

- We continued redesigning the [main window of *Tails
  Installer*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-May/003374.html).

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

## Reproducible builds

Here are some details about our work in April on making Tails
reproducible. This effort is coverd by the Mozilla Open Source Support
grant (MOSS) that we've received.

Our IUKs (Increment Upgrade Kits) are now reproducible, however, one
remaining issue currently blocks us from claiming that our ISO images
are too. We are confident that this issue will be solved in the next
few weeks.

### Reproducible infrastructure

After a long discussion, we [[!tails_ticket 12409 desc="decided"]] not
to publish any Vagrant basebox at all: the key argument in favour of
this major design change was to remove one huge binary blob from the
list of trusted inputs needed for building a Tails ISO image.
This will substantially increase the value of Tails ISO images
building reproducibly. This decision has a few nice side effects,
including:

 * the properties of the basebox required to build a given state of our
   code base are entirely encoded in the corresponding Git commit;
 * changes in the ISO build box definition don't require building and
   uploading a new basebox.

Then we made enough progress to migrate our Continuous Integration
platform to the build system used by developers. This is now running
in production, not exactly smoothly yet (as explained below), but well
enough to keep supporting our development and quality assurance
processes. For details, see [[!tails_ticket 11972]],
[[!tails_ticket 11979]], [[!tails_ticket 11980]],
[[!tails_ticket 11981]], [[!tails_ticket 12017]], and
[[!tails_ticket 11006]].

Then we had to deal with a number of issues that we were not in
a position to identify before submitting this brand new system to
a real-world workload. Some are fixed already
([[!tails_ticket 12530]], [[!tails_ticket 12578]],
[[!tails_ticket 12565]], [[!tails_ticket 12541]],
[[!tails_ticket 12529]], [[!tails_ticket 12575]],
[[!tails_ticket 12606]]). Work is still in progress on some other
problems: they are our Continuous Integration engineers' top priority,
and should be fully resolved in the next couple of months.

Finally, we have [[!tails_ticket 12579 desc="set up"]] automated tests for
the reproducibility of our ISO image. Obviously, the results of these
tests
[are publicly available](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/reproducibly_build_Tails_ISO_testing/builds/).

### Reproducible website build

In march, we've made great progress to get our website build
reproducibly.  Later on, we realized that ikiwiki recompressed some
images of our website which sometimes contained timestamped metadata,
thus making the ISO image build unreproducibly. We have fixed this on
our side [[!tails_ticket 12526]], and a currently sending these
modifications upstream [[!tails_ticket 12525]].

### The blocker: fontconfig

The cloud which hides the blue skies and the sun in the reproducible
builds solar system today, and which is our sole remaining problem to
make our ISO image build reproducibly is this: We ship a cache for fonts
in Tails. However, this cache is currently not reproducible. In march we
had moved its' generation out of the ISO, however, it makes the image
boot slower and resulted in too many unreliable test failures. Thus, we
decided to try to move it back into the ISO image and to fix the root
cause of the problem. We filed [Debian bug
863427](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=863427), but
we already know that our patch is not yet enough to fix the problem,
although it greatly reduces the number of differences from 75 to 5
([[!tails_ticket #12567]]).

### ISO and IUK

When we generate the ISO image using isohybrid, we pass it an ID. We
tried setting this ID to $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH which resulted in a
reproducible, but non-hybrid, ISO. Thus, we decided to pass a fixed ID
instead. [[!tails_ticket #12453]]

### The bright future

Remaining technical issues are tracked on [[!tails_ticket #12608]].

We are working on documenting how to modify our release process to ship
reproducible ISO images ([[!tails_ticket #12628]], [[!tails_ticket
#12629]]).

For those of our users who want to verify own ISO builds against ours,
we'll soon publish a procedure how to do that ([[!tails_ticket
#12630]]).


Funding
=======

XXX: The fundraising team should look at the fundraising Git.

       git log --patch --since='1 December' --until='1 January' origin/master

XXX: The fundraising and accounting teams should look at the archives of <tails-fundraising@boum.org> and <tails-accounting@boum.org>.

- We are still in the process of discussing our proposal with OTF, and
  reworking it accordingly.

- We started migrating our European fiscal sponsor from Zwiebelfreunde
  to [CCT, the Center for the Cultivation of Technology](https://techcultivation.org/).

* 110 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

XXX: Ask tails@boum.org for these numbers.
