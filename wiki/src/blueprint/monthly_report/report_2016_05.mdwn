  report on his GSoC on *Tails Server*.

Documentation and website
=========================

- sajolida finished replacing the old installation instructions we had before
  the installation assistant. This implied rewriting our instructions for
  [[OpenPGP verification|install/download/openpgp]] which now include a direct
  download link. We are [[!tails_ticket 11024 desc="still discussing"]] how to
  better link this page to make it easier to find.

  Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/i2p#index2h1]].

  website](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-project/2016-May/000508.html).

User experience

  Server*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-May/000953.html).

- We discussed the design of the [**Unlock** and **Relock** widgets of the
  new *Tails Greeter*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-May/000952.html).

- kurono wrote a [simplified interface for *Tails
  Installer*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-May/000990.html)
  that would allow removing the splash screen and asked for reviews of
  his design.

  Source Support](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/05/11/mozilla-open-source-support-moss-now-open-to-all-projects/).
