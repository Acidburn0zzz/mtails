Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We improved our donation page in preparation of the donation campaign
  to mention CCT instead of Zwiebelfreunde and be better structured.

User experience
===============

- We installed [*LimeSurvey* on our infrastructure](https://survey.tails.boum.org)
  and advertised a first survey on file storage encryption from the homepage of
  *Tor Browser* in Tails. Our users have been [very responsive to our
  call](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-October/003505.html)
  and since then we have gathered 30 complete answers to the survey each
  day on average, reaching 375 in total on October 30.

- We extensively tested older and newer versions of UUI to understand why
  [[!tails_ticket 13206 desc="cloning from a USB stick installed using UUI
  sometimes fails"]]. Everything is fine as long as "*Format in FAT32*" is
  checked which is documented but not always applied by users, so we should
  either improve UUI, our documentation, or *Tails Greeter* to prevent that.

- We continued to port our verification extension for Firefox to Web
  Extensions and [we now have a working prototype](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2017-October/011817.html)!
  that computes the checksum in a reasonable time (45 seconds).

Hot topics on our help desk

Infrastructure
==============

- For our installation of *LimeSurvey*, we implemented an automatic monitoring
  of new upstream versions to notify system administrators when a security
  update is available ([Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/monitor-limesurvey-releases)).

Funding
=======

- The proposal that we submitted to the [Lush Digital Fund](https://uk.lush.com/article/introducing-digital-fund)
  in May was accepted. It will fund the integration of a web-based translation
  platform in the build of our website and documentation.

- We published our [[finances for 2016|doc/about/finances#2016]].

- We launched our 2017 donation campaign and blogged about [[Many hands make
  Tails|news/many_hands_make_tails]].
