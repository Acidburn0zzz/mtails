Releases
========

* Tails 3.9 is scheduled for September 5.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

We worked more on integrating our future web translation platform with
our infrastructure. This platform is currently not production ready but
is being tested and used by a few translators.

- We wrote Git hooks for all machines and contributors using Git.

- We wrote and improved several scripts that check the validity of PO
  files that we carry. We need these scripts to further automate our
  translation processes, hence all translators, humans and interfaces
  need to respect certain rules when committing PO files to our
  repository. This is currently not active and still needs to be tested
  more extensively.

- We are working on ikiwiki, our website engine, to fix a long standing
  bug that renders PO files as markdown files, preventing us to include
  translation files for non-active languages.

We worked on new package versions for torbirdy, tails-installer and
onionshare.

Documentation and website
=========================

We updated our [[installation instructions for Debian|install/debian/usb]] to:

Infrastructure
==============

We asked [Wikimedia](https://mirrors.wikimedia.org/) to become our
primary download and fallback mirror, and they accepted. We'll implement
this change in the coming months.  Thank you Wikimedia!

We've updated our web translation platform to a recent version. The
process went smoothly.

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

Funding
=======

- We analyzed the results from last year's donation campaign.

  We got more money than in 2016 (101&thinsp;664â‚¬, +34%) but from less donations (-43%).

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

- One of us attended [PETS](https://petsymposium.org).
