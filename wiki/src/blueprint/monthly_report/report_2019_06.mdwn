Releases
========

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We published a new version of the verification extension with a non-minified
  Forge library, as per an updated Mozilla policy. [[!tails_ticket 16686]]

  we [[!tails_ticket 15510 desc="ported our infrastructure to puppetlabs-apt"]].
