Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:
       - Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
       - Remove screenshots.
       - Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
       - Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

User experience
===============

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

* XXX ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure. XXX=ask tails-sysadmins@boum.org

- We published a mechanism for the [[distribution and activation of the
  revocation certificate of the Tails signing
  key|doc/about/openpgp_keys/signing_key_revocation]]. It allows revoking
  the Tails signing key even if very bad things happens to most of the
  team while making it hard for isolated and malicious individuals to revoke
  the signing key when not needed. We encourage experts to review this
  mechanism and other projects to adopt similar practices.

Funding
=======

- We launched a donation campaign to run until the end of 2016. We already
  raised [56 bitcoins](https://blockchain.info/charts/balance?timespan=30days&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2)!

- We published our [[financial report for 2015|doc/about/finances#2015]].

- Our proposal for [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/request/) on porting to
  Debian Stretch was accepted in the second round.

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

- DrWhax, intrigeri, and sajolida attended the OTF summit. It was a wonderful
  opportunity to strengthen our relationships with the Internet freedom
  community at large: other secure operating systems, usability experts,
  translators, technical writers, funders, trainers, and Tails enthusiasts in
  general, etc.
