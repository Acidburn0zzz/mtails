Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

- So far, everyone who tried reproducing the Tails 3.2~rc1 and 3.2 ISO
  images succeeded. So here's a challenge for you: can you manage to
  get a different ISO by following our [[build|contribute/build]] and
  [[verification|contribute/build/reproducible#verify-iso]] instructions?

- We are improving integration of the _Orca screen reader_ and the
  _GNOME screen keyboard_ into Tails ([[!tails_ticket 14752]],
  [[!tails_ticket 8260]]). A discussion about the screen reader's user
  experience has been [[!tails_ticket 14713 desc="initiated"]] by
  Pablo Natalino, and intrigeri [[!gnomebug 788369 desc="started"]]
  a discussion upstream about the long-press delay for typing special
  chars with it.

- We have formalized how the AppArmor profile for _Thunderbird_ is
  maintained in Debian and upstream. This clarifies where and how our
  contributions should be submitted and At the end of the day this
  should avoid the need to maintain a Tails-specific delta.

- We are working on fixing _Seahorse_ buggy interfacing with
  _pinentry-gtk2_ upstream ([[!gnomebug 787543]], [[!debbug 869416]]).
  A workaround was applied in Tails 3.2 already but we try hard to
  stick to our [[contribute/relationship_with_upstream]] statement.

Documentation and website
=========================

XXX: Explore the Git history:

         git log --patch --since='1 October' --until='1 November' origin/master -- "*.*m*"

 * We greatly improved our [[instructions for building the Tails ISO image|contribute/build/]] and created a new section about how to [[verify that the Tails ISO image is reproducible|contribute/build/reproducible/]].
 * We are documenting the process for Tails contributors to request
   sponsorship when attending events on behalf of Tails, in order to
   improve fairness and to streamline how the simplest cases are
   handled. This documentation should land on our website by the end
   of the year.
