Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

We've continued to work on making Tails ISO images reproducible.

- We fixed all of the issues that were identified by our first build testers.
- So far, everyone who tried reproducing the Tails 3.2~rc1 and 3.2 ISO
  images succeeded. So here's a challenge for you: can you manage to
  get a different ISO by following our [[build|contribute/build]] and
  [[verification|contribute/build/reproducible#verify-iso]] instructions?
- We published a [[blueprint|blueprint/reproducible_builds/report_to_RB_community/]] which explains how we did it.

- We are improving integration of the _Orca screen reader_ and the
  _GNOME screen keyboard_ into Tails ([[!tails_ticket 14752]],
  [[!tails_ticket 8260]]). A discussion about the screen reader's user
  experience has been [[!tails_ticket 14713 desc="initiated"]] by
  Pablo Natalino, and intrigeri [[!gnomebug 788369 desc="started"]]
  a discussion upstream about the long-press delay for typing special
  chars with it.

- We have formalized how the AppArmor profile for _Thunderbird_ is
  maintained in Debian and upstream. This clarifies where and how our
  contributions should be submitted and At the end of the day this
  should avoid the need to maintain a Tails-specific delta.

- We are working on fixing _Seahorse_ buggy interfacing with
  _pinentry-gtk2_ upstream ([[!gnomebug 787543]], [[!debbug 869416]]).
  A workaround was applied in Tails 3.2 already but we try hard to
  stick to our [[contribute/relationship_with_upstream]] statement.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We updated our [[roadmap|contribute/roadmap]] with our priorities for
  the next years.

- We greatly improved our [[instructions for building the Tails ISO
  image|contribute/build/]] and created a new section about how to
  [[verify that the Tails ISO image is
  reproducible|contribute/build/reproducible/]].

- We are documenting the process for Tails contributors to request
  sponsorship when attending events on behalf of Tails, in order to
  improve fairness and to streamline how the simplest cases are handled.
  This documentation should land on our website by the end of the year.

- We documented hardware limitations for Tails on [[Intel Atom Cherry
  Trail tablets|support/known_issues#cherry-trail]].

User experience
===============

- We designed a [[new download page|install/download_2]], to prepare for
  the migration of our verification extension to *Web Extensions*. We
  started [drawing sketchy
  wireframes](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-September/003450.html),
  then improved them incrementally after testing them on paper with
  users, and finally [implemented the resulting prototype in
  HTML](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2017-September/011694.html).

- We benchmarked [[open source web applications to survey our user
  base|blueprint/survey_platform]]. [The best candidate is
  *LimeSurvey*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-September/003472.html)
  and we will do a test deployment in October as part of a user research
  on the use of *VeraCrypt*.

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

- We finished upgrading all our systems to Debian Stretch
  ([[!tails_ticket 12160]]).
- We upgraded our Redmine instance ([[!tails_ticket 11808]]).

Funding
=======

- We sent a thank you email to everybody who donated in 2016.

- We signed a new contract with OTF that will run from September 1,
  2017 to August 31, 2018 and that covers mainly:
  - [[!tails_ticket 14468 desc="VeraCrypt support in GNOME: make it easier to integrate Tails into workflows with other users and operating systems"]]
  - Additional software: make it easier to tailor Tails to specific
    needs for sensitive data manipulation ([[!tails_ticket 14568]],
    [[!tails_ticket 5551]] and friends)

- We worked on making our [[Partners]] page easier to translate
  ([[!tails_ticket 12646]]).

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

* The 5th version of the [Guide d'autodéfense numérique](https://guide.boum.org) was released. This book proposes ways to understand how the digital world functions, what solutions can we organise against certain types of attacks, and what tools can help do that.

Upcoming events
---------------

* Some of us will attend the
  [Reproducible Builds summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2017/)
  in Berlin (October 31 to November 2).

* Many Tails people will be at the
  [34th Chaos Communication Congress, aka. 34C3](https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2017/34C3-in-leipzig)
  in Leipzig (December 27 to December 30).

Metrics
=======

* Tails has been started more than BOOTS/MONTH times this month. This makes BOOTS/DAY boots a day on average.
* SIGS downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO from our website.
* 92 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

XXX: Ask tails@boum.org for these numbers.
