Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|bugfix|emergency] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- A bunch of Foundations Team members had a sprint focused on porting
  Tails to Debian 10 (Buster). For details, see the
  [full report](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190112.093556.b591a963.en.html).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We wrote brand new installation instructions using:

  - [[*Etcher* for Windows|install/win/usb]]
  - [[*Etcher* for macOS|install/mac/usb]]
  - [[*GNOME Disks* for Linux|install/linux/usb]]

- We wrote how to [[troubleshooting Wi-Fi not
  working|doc/anonymous_internet/networkmanager]] and which USB Wi-Fi adapters
  work in Tails.

- We documented how to [[disable the automatic screen
  locker|doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop#screen-locker]]
  if you configure an administration password.

- We added several entries to our writing style guide:

  - [[*vulnerability*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#vulnerability]]
  - [[*HTML anchors*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#anchors]]
  - [[*update* vs *upgrade*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#update]]
  - [[*boot* vs *start*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#boot]]
  - [[*network interface*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#network-interface]]
  - [[*media*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#media]]
  - [[*administration password*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#administration-password]]
  - [[*future tense*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#future-tense]]
  - [[*earlier* and *later*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#earlier]]

User experience
===============

- We published an [[interview with Bea|blueprint/interviews#Bea]] who is
  spreading the use of Tails in a grassroots political organization in Latin
  America.

- We added visual feedback upstream when opening
  [KeePassXC](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/2593),
  [Electrum](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/pull/4997), and
  [OnionShare](https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/pull/867).

- We [evaluated the cost/benefit of solving many small UX
  improvements](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/issues/14544#note-75).

Infrastructure
==============

- Our infrastructure was targeted by a distributed denial-of-service
  (DDoS) attack that caused a couple of temporary outages. We're
  discussing ways to protect ourselves in the future.

- We kept polishing the automated test suite for Additional Software
  and hope it will be merged in time for the next Tails release.

- We kept investigating options to make our CI faster, shorten the
  development feedback loop, and thus make our developers' work more
  efficient and pleasurable. We will soon be able to benchmark our
  currently preferred option.

- We dealt with the fallout of the big infrastructure changes done in
  December. A few issues remain but things are starting to run more
  smoothly again :)

Funding
=======

- We close our end-of-year donation campaign. We don't have the final numbers
  yet.

- We submitted 2 applications to the NLnet [NGI Zero
  PET](https://nlnet.nl/PET/) project.
