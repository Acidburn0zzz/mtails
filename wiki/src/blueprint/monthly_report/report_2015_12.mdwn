[[!meta title="Tails report from September to December 2015"]]

It's been a pretty long time since the last report. We were
quite busy and didn't find the time to write our monthly reports since August 2015.
This report will covers the last third of 2015.

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.6 was released on September 22, 2015.|news/version_1.6]] (major release)

* [[Tails 1.7 was released on November 3, 2015.|news/version_1.7]] (major release)

* [[Tails 1.8 was released on December 15, 2015.|news/version_1.8]] (major release)

* [[Tails 1.8.1 was released on December 19, 2015.|news/version_1.8.1]] (minor release)

Code
====

For details, see each release announcement. Notable changes include:

* 1.7: You can now start Tails in [[offline mode|doc/first_steps/startup_options/offline_mode]]
       to disable all networking for additional security. Doing so can be
       useful when working on sensitive documents.

* 1.8: <span class="application">[[Icedove|doc/anonymous_internet/icedove]]</span>, a
       rebranded version of <span class="application">Mozilla Thunderbird</span> is,
       now the official email client in Tails, replacing
       <span class="application">Claws Mail</span>.
       As with Claws, Icedove allows you to encrypt and decrypt emails easily and sends all
       traffic through the Tor network.

Infrastructure
==============

  - We were able to deploy automated tests of ISO images built
    automatically for our main release branches in the beginning of
    October.

  - The new snapshot system improved robustness of our test suite
    noticeably, and reduced the amount of time needed for a full run
    with at least 30%.
