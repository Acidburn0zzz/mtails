Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

* We fixed issues regarding reproducible builds
  ([[!tails_ticket 14924]], [[!tails_ticket 14946]],
  [[!tails_ticket 14933]]) and later realized that one of them fixes
  did not work in some corner casesâ€¦ that include the ISO images we
  build for the Tails official releases. Sadly, due to an internal
  communication mishap we've announced that Tails 3.3 was reproducible
  before we had learned about this remaining problem.

* We uploaded a new version of tails-installer (5.0.2) to Debian and Ubuntu.
  This version has a simpler interface than previous versions.

Documentation and website
=========================

* We have documented internally how active Tails contributors can be
  sponsored to attend events on behalf of Tails and are now working
  towards publishing this documentation so that all contributors are
  aware of this option ([[!tails_ticket 14727]]).

User experience
===============

- We almost finished the work on the new download page and verification
  extension for Firefox and Chrome. We're stick blocked by security
  reviews and improvements on the JavaScript code.

- Our survey on file storage encryption was answered 1012 times between
  October 17 and December 1. It was a huge success and we'll not move on
  to analyzing the results.

Funding

  Summit that we are organizing with Qubes OS, Subgraph OS and Whonix.

* We applied to the "Good of the Internet" call for proposals by RIPE
