Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|bugfix|emergency] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We updated most of our documentation to Tails based on Debian 10
  (Buster). ([[!tails_ticket 16282]])

- We simplified and updated our description of the system requirements.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11663]] and [[!tails_ticket 16810]]).

- We fixed the display of the "Tor check" button on the homepage of *Tor
  Browser*. ([[!tails_ticket 15312]])

  It is used by around 10% of users.

- We removed the "% translated" indication from our website because it was
  misleading. ([[!tails_ticket 16867]])

User experience
===============

- [Odile Carabantes](https://studiomoare.com/) and [Enso
  Studio](https://www.ensostudio.tv/) created an animation on
  [[using the boot menu to start Tails|install/win/usb#animation]].

- We tested 2 alternatives to *Etcher* as it has some privacy issues
  ([[!tails_ticket 16381]]):

  - Rawrite32 ([[!tails_ticket 16553]])
  - Win32 Disk Images ([[!tails_ticket 14447]])

- We proposed some small improvements to adjust *Tails Installer* to the
  fact that we are now distributing USB images:

  - Rename *Tails Installer* as *Tails Cloner* ([[!tails_ticket 16907]])
  - Use USB images instead of ISO images in *Tails Installer* ([[!tails_ticket 16906]])

- We proposed a design to [[use *Tails Installer* to backup the
  persistent volume|blueprint/backups]].

Infrastructure
==============

- We finished fixing the description of the mechanism for the
  [[revocation of the Tails signing
  key|doc/about/openpgp_keys/signing_key_revocation]] after an external
  review. ([[!tails_ticket 15604]])

- We discussed additions of new people to the Tails signing key
  revocation mechanism.

- The new backups system for our entire infrastructure is live.
  [[!tails_ticket 15071]]

- We upgraded our Puppet master (sic) to Debian 10 (Buster), which
  supports PuppetDB out of the box. This allowed us to drop a bunch of
  hackish workarounds and it was a great way to fast-track the
  onboarding of zen, our new sysadmin. [[!tails_ticket 16460]]

- We made great progress on our [web translation
  platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/):
  - We fixed a number of bugs identified since we submitted the platform
    to a production workload.
  - We modified in depth the permissions model to address issues identified
    by a security review.
  - We sent a public call for testing.
  - We kept working on documentation for translators.
  - We adjusted the resources allocated to the VM that runs this platform
    and deployed Apache `mod_security` to make it a bit less scary.

Funding
=======

- Our proposal to the [Mozilla Open Source Support](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/)
  was accepted. It will fund our work to:

  - Improve Upgrades, late 2019 and early 2020 ([[!tails_ticket 8415]] and [[!tails_ticket 15281]])
  - Support Secure Boot, mid 2020 ([[!tails_ticket 6560]])
  - Migrate to GitLab, early 2020 ([[!tails_ticket 15878]])
