Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|bugfix|emergency] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- The [[Foundations
  Team|contribute/working_together/roles/foundations_team]] met for
  a sprint focused on porting Tails to Debian 10 (Buster):
  [report](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190408.075929.1c2952c0.en.html),
  [next
  steps](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190429.091241.82e34497.en.html).
- We finalized our criteria for including dictionaries, fonts and language packs,
  which will be reflected in TailsÂ 3.14.
- We prototyped a USB image with Secure Boot support and GRUB, in order
  to better understand what implementation difficulties we should expect.
- We
  [submitted](https://ikiwiki.info/todo/_Add_ikiwiki_PO-Plugin_to_ignore_languages/)
  to ikiwiki upstream a branch that makes it keep PO files up-to-date
  for a set of languages that are not ready to be enabled and visible
  on the live website yet. This will allow us to merge into our main
  Git repository changes made via our upcoming Weblate-based
  translation platform, which supports languages whose
  work-in-progress translation is not ready for prime-time yet.
- We
  [uploaded](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1038188/accepted-gnome-shell-3302-6-source-into-unstable/)
  to Debian a few fixes for regressions in the GNOME on-screen keyboard.

Infrastructure
==============

- The Foundations Team started experimenting with GitLab for
  [merge requests](https://salsa.debian.org/tails-team/tails/merge_requests/?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged).
- We started looking into how GitLab could work for our issues
  tracking and [[drafted a rough plan|blueprint/GitLab]].

Funding
=======

XXX: The fundraising team should look at the fundraising Git.

       git log --patch --since='1 December' --until='1 January' origin/master

XXX: The fundraising and accounting teams should look at the archives of <tails-fundraising@boum.org> and <tails-accounting@boum.org>.

- We started working on a proposal for [Mozilla Open Source Support

On-going discussions

- We [studied and narrowed down our
  options](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190429.094536.22d3598f.en.html)
  regarding the future of Electrum in Tails. It seems there will be
  a way forward, although it's unclear at this point how much effort
  it will require from us.
