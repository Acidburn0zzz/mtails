Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|bugfix|emergency] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

* We started to integrate _Tor Browser_ 9.0 ([[!tails_ticket 16356]]).

* We started working on the upgrade to _Thunderbird_ 68
  ([[!tails_ticket 16771]]).

* We did lots of work to improve the reliability of our test suite.

* We did some initial research and tests on using _Portals_ to improve
  the UX of saving downloaded files from _Tor Browser_ ([[!tails_ticket
  10422]], [[!tails_ticket 15678]]).

* We did some initial research on redesigning, in a Wayland-compatible
  way, our current sudo-based privilege separation model
  ([[!tails_ticket 12213]] and subtasks).

* We improved the UX of the _Greeter_ and fixed a few of its most
  annoying bugs ([[!tails_ticket 16095]] and the tickets it blocks).
  This work will hopefully land in time for TailsÂ 4.0 :)

Infrastructure
==============

* We upgraded our very old Jenkins to the current LTS version
  ([[!tails_ticket 10068]]). This in turn allowed us to implement
  a bunch of improvements and bugfixes that had been blocked by this
  postponed upgrade.

* We kept working on making our [web translation
  platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/) ready for prime-time.
  We're almost there!

Funding
=======

XXX: The fundraising team should look at the fundraising Git.

       git log --patch --since='1 December' --until='1 January' origin/master

XXX: The fundraising and accounting teams should look at the archives of <tails-fundraising@boum.org> and <tails-accounting@boum.org>.

  Guardian Project.
