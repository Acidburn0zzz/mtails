=========================

* sajolida rewrote the [instructions for OpenPGP verification](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/tree/wiki/src/install/download/openpgp.mdwn?h=web/9323-replace-old-documentation)
  as part of small improvements to make the installation assistant less
  frustrating for power users.

User experience
===============

* Alan [built an ISO image](http://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_feature-8230-greeter-revamp-phase1/lastSuccessful/archive/latest.iso)

  [asked for review](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-April/000913.html).

* segfault was approved to work on [[Tails Server|blueprint/tails_server]]
  as his Google Summer of Code and already sent [some mockups for a user
  interface](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-April/000918.html).

Infrastructure
==============
* We moved our contributors chat to an [[XMPP channel|xmpp://tails-dev@conference.riseup.net]]. More infos  [[here|contribute/chat]]
* We are updating our mirror infrastructure to allow more mirrors as well as to switch all downloads to HTTPS in the future [[Blueprint||https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/HTTP_mirror_pool/]]. Nearly all mirror operators have already adopted the new configuration of their server. We have updated our [[https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/mirror/||documentation for hosting a mirror]]. Mirror operators now have an own mailinglist.
