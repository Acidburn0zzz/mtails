Releases
========

* Tails 3.10 is [[scheduled for October 23|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

- We organized the [[contribute/working_together/roles/Foundations_Team]] biggest tasks for the end of the year: porting Tails to Buster, [[!tails_ticket 15349 desc="migrate away from vmdebootstrap"]], [[!tails_ticket 15460 desc="make our test suite work with Java 9+"]], [[!tails_ticket 8415 desc="migrate from `aufs` to `overlayfs`"]], [[!tails_ticket 15281 desc="improve the upgrade UX"]].
- We completed lots of work in time for Tails 3.9:
  - Updated *Tor Browser* to 8.0, based on *Firefox* 60 ESR.
  - Updated *Thunderbird* from 52 to [60](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/60.0/releasenotes/).
  - Updated *Tor* to 0.3.4.7-rc.
  - Updated *Linux* to 4.17 which also fixes the
    [Foreshadow](https://foreshadowattack.eu/) attack.
  - Use *Tor Browser* again for browsing the documentation offline.
    ([[!tails_ticket 15720]])
- We fixed a number of regressions identified in Tails 3.9~rc1.
- We worked on making our branch based on Debian 10 (Buster)
  build again. ([[!tails_ticket 15857]])

Documentation and website
=========================

We documented how to:

- [[Install additional software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]].

- [[Unlock VeraCrypt volumes|doc/encryption_and_privacy/veracrypt]].

- Fix [[Persistent folder disappearing and persistent feature
  configurations not loading|support/known_issues#persistence-disappears]].

- Fix [[Tails behaving weirdly if an automatic upgrade is only
  partially applied|support/known_issues#partial-upgrade]].

- Calculate the [[food budget for contributors attending events
  on behalf of Tails|contribute/sponsorship_to_attend_events]].

User experience
===============

- We presented a first version of our personas to the community and
  agreed on focusing on [[Riou, The Censorship
  Evader|blueprint/personas#riou]], as our primary persona.

<a href="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/personas/posters.pdf"><img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/personas/posters.png"></a>

- We completed the [[collaboration with Simply
  Secure|blueprint/explain_tails/simsec]] on the Tails identity (aka.
  "brand") and making it easier to understand what is Tails and how it
  works. This work lays the foundation to:

  - Redefining our visual style and tone.
  - [[Explanation of Tails|blueprint/explain_tails]] on our home and about pages.

  We will report on this in more details later.

- We improved the readability of our HTML tables. See for example
  [[support/known_issues/graphics]].
