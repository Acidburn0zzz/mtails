Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

We documented how to:

- [[Install additional software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]].

- [[Unlock VeraCrypt volumes|doc/encryption_and_privacy/veracrypt]].

- Fix [[Persistent folder disappearing and persistent feature
  configurations not loading|support/known_issues#persistence-disappears]].

- Fix [[Tails behaving weirdly if an automatic upgrade is only
  partially applied|support/known_issues#partial-upgrade]].

- Calculate the [[food budget for contributors attending events
  on behalf of Tails|contribute/sponsorship_to_attend_events]].

User experience
===============

- We presented a first version of our personas to the community and
  agreed on focusing on [[Riou, The Censorship
  Evader|blueprint/personas#riou]], as our primary persona.

<a href="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/personas/posters.pdf"><img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/personas/posters.png"></a>

- We completed the [[collaboration with Simply
  Secure|blueprint/explain_tails/simsec]] on the Tails identity (aka.
  "brand") and making it easier to understand what is Tails and how it
  works. This work lays the foundation to:

  - Redefining our visual style and tone.
  - [[Explanation of Tails|blueprint/explain_tails]] on our home and about pages.

  We will report on this in more details later.
