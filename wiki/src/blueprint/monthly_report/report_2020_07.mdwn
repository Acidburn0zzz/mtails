     the next version).

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

We started the month with Tails 4.8 and many users wrote to us because of problems with the Tails Welcom Screen:

1. They had issues with [[!tails_ticket 17792 desc="administration passwords that had special characters"]]

1. They could not access their persistent storage because [[!tails_ticket 17794 desc="changing the language on the Welcome Screen didn't change the keyboard layout"]] as usual, although it claimed to do it. 

This two issues were very upsetting for the users, although had easy workarounds. They are fixed in Tails 4.9 (Apologies!), but in the same time the kernel upgrade brought new issues (Re: Apologies!):

1. A lot of people reported the starting Tails was impossible since the upgrade to Tails 4.9 with their Intel Corporation [8086:22b0] [[GPU|https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/16447#note_153909]].

1. some people reported that their wi-fi adapter [[was not working anymore|https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/17786#note_152948]].
