Releases
========

[[Tails 4.7 was released on June 2|news/version_4.7]]:

- Make the installation of Additional Software more robust. ([[!tails_ticket 17278]])

- Clarify the error message when entering an incorrect password to unlock a
  VeraCrypt volume: *Wrong passphrase or parameters* instead of *Error
  unlocking volume*. ([[!tails_ticket 17668]])

- Clean up confusing comments in `/etc/tor/torrc`. ([[!tails_ticket 17706]])

[[Tails 4.8 was released on June 30|news/version_4.8]]:

- We disabled the *Unsafe Browser* by default and clarified that [[the
  *Unsafe Browser* can be used to deanonymize
  you|doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser#security]].

- We added a new feature of the Persistent Storage to save the settings
  from the Welcome Screen.

  This feature is beta and only the additional setting to enable the
  *Unsafe Browser* is made persistent. The other settings (language,
  keyboard, and other additional settings) will be made persistent in
  Tails 4.9 (July 28).

- Fix the *Find in page* feature of *Thunderbird*. ([[!tails_ticket

  with the Tails USB stick removed. ([[!tails_ticket 16787]])

  network interface is disabled. ([[!tails_ticket 17779]])

- Fix the import of OpenPGP public keys in binary format (non armored)
  from the *Files* browser.
