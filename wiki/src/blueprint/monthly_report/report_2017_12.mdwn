Releases
========

* No Tails update was released in December 2018.

* We updated our [[release schedule for 2018|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

* We published our [[plans for 2018|news/our_plans_for_2018]].

* We started improving the backend of the [[*Additional Software*|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]] persistent
  feature. We worked on:

  - Not blocking the opening of the desktop ([[!tails_ticket 9059]],
  [[Blueprint|blueprint/additional_software_packages/dont_block_desktop_startup]]).
  - Making it work offline ([[!tails_ticket 14570]],
  [[Blueprint|blueprint/additional_software_packages/offline_mode]]).

Documentation and website
=========================


* sajolida added a blueprint about [[restructuring our suppport page|blueprint/support_page]]

User experience
===============

* We [[analyzed the results of our online survey|https://tails.boum.org/contribute/reports/SponsorW/2017_12/#index1h2]]
  about VeraCrypt support in GNOME.

* There was also a three day sprint about VeraCrypt at the beginning of December including
  [[a user testing session|news/veracrypt_ux_design]].

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. [[!tails_ticket 15066 desc="Tor Browser cannot print to file"]]

Infrastructure
==============

 - We have converted two sources of email sent by cron with Icinga 2
   monitoring checks that are easier to track and fine-tune
   ([[!tails_ticket 11598]], [[!tails_ticket 12455]]).

 - We have fixed a longstanding bug that made the UX of our CI system
   confusing when deleting a branch in Git ([[!tails_ticket 15069]]).

 - We have set up a local email server on every Jenkins node that runs
   automated ISO tests, as a first step towards making our automatic
   _Thunderbird_ tests more robust ([[!tails_ticket 12277]]).

 - We have tuned our servers to get a little bit better performance
   out of our CI system ([[!tails_ticket 15054]]).

 - We have [[extended the blueprint about upgrading the hardware for
   automated tests|blueprint/hardware_for_automated_tests_take3/]].

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

 - 34c3: A fair number of Tails developers and contributors attended
   the [[34th Chaos Communication Congress (34c3)|https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Main_Page]]
   in Leipzig.
   During this event, we set up a table to meet with interested parties-
   users, contributors, or anyone interested.
   We were able to reach both newcomers and long-time users of Tails,
   answer questions, help, exchange stickers, give away USB keys and
   t-shirts in exchange of donations, get feedback or just chat.
   It was, of course, also a great opportunity to meet people in person,
   discuss, work, and have fun both within the project and with friend projects.

Upcoming events
---------------

 - We will have a booth [[at FOSDEM|http://fosdem.org/2018]] in Brussels.
