Upcoming releases
=================

* With the Tails 3.12 release [[scheduled for January
  29|contribute/calendar]], we will start distributing *USB images* in
  addition to *ISO images*. This will drastically simplify the
  installation for Windows and macOS and improve support for
  UEFI computers!

* Tails 3.11, [[scheduled for December 11|contribute/calendar]],
  will fix a great number of long-standing problems and recent
  regressions.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

* We've been working hard since a few months on our USB image project
  ([[!tails_ticket 15292]]) and will soon send a call for testing.
  The main remaining challenge is to build the USB image reproducibly
  ([[!tails_ticket 15985]]).

* We resumed work on porting Tails to Debian 10 (Buster).
  Our Foundations Team will have a sprint focused on this topic next
  month and should publish a first beta release by the end of April.

* We identified and fixed one root cause for a major problem some
  users face when upgrading Tails: part of the user interface that
  provided feedback about the progress of the upgrade was broken,
  which lead users to restart Tails before the upgrade was fully
  applied. While we were at it, we improved the user experience of the
  upgrade process, which will now require user confirmation before
  shutting down the network connection. ([[!tails_ticket 14754]],
  [[!tails_ticket 15282]])

Infrastructure
==============

We made good progress on adjusting our infrastructure to upcoming
changes at our previous providers:

* We now host our website on our own infrastructure. An unintended but
  welcome side-effect is that browsing our website is snappier than it
  used to. ([[!tails_ticket 14588]])
* We renamed our Redmine instance from <https://labs.riseup.net/> to
  <https://redmine.tails.boum.org/>. This avoids confusion about who
  is responsible for this service and it will allow our Riseup friends
  to set up *single sign-on* (SSO) for their own services.

Funding
=======

We continued working on our yearly donation campaign:

* We added to our donation banner a counter for the total amount. We
  reached 23% of our fundraising goal in the first half of the campaign.

* We got 64% more donors but raised 51% less in amount compared to
  last year. More people are donating but we are missing the big donors
  that we had in the past.
