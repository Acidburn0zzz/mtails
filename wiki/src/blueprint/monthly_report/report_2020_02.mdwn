Releases
========

* [[Tails 4.3 was released on February 11|news/version_4.3]]. (bugfix release)

* [[Tails 4.3.1|contribute/calendar]]potential emergency release that traditionally follows [[pwn2own|https://cansecwest.com/]] (March 18-20)

* Tails 4.4 is [[scheduled for March 10|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.3:

- We included the `trezor` package, which provides a command line tool
  to use a Trezor hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.

- Update *Tor Browser* to [9.0.5](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-905).

- Update *Thunderbird* to [68.4.1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/1.2.3/releasenotes/).

- Update *Linux* to 5.4.13. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.).

- Update *Tor* to 0.4.2.6.

- Update the *VirtualBox Guest Additions* to 6.1.2.

- Fix the progress bar and prevent closing the window while an upgrade
  is being applied. ([[!tails_ticket 16603]])

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We made great progress on Secure boot support ([[!tails_ticket 6560]])
  and are now quite confident we can ship this in a couple months
  in Tails 4.5. Thanks to everyone who answered our call for testing!

- In order to make the development process a bit smoother, we improved the
  performance of our builds ([[!tails_ticket 17439]], [[!tails_ticket 17386]]).

- We kept working on replacing Sikuli in our test suite ([[!tails_ticket
  15460]]), which will allow running it on recent Debian systems.
  We're almost there! :)
