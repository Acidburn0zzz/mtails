Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.14 was released on May 21|news/version_3.14]] ([bugfix release).

* Tails 3.15 is [[scheduled for July 9|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.14:

- Enable all available mitigations for the MDS (Microarchitectural Data Sampling)
  attacks and disable [[!wikipedia Simultaneous_multithreading desc="SMT"]]
  (simultaneous multithreading) on all vulnerable processors to fix the
  [RIDL, Fallout](https://mdsattacks.com/) and
  [ZombieLoad](https://zombieloadattack.com/) security vulnerabilities.

- Remove the following applications:

  - Desktop applications
    - *Gobby*
    - *Pitivi*
    - *Traverso*

  - Command-line tools
    - `hopenpgp-tools`
    - `keyringer`
    - `monkeysign`
    - `monkeysphere`
    - `msva-perl`
    - `paperkey`
    - `pwgen`
    - `ssss`
    - `pdf-redact-tools`

  You can install these applications again using the
  *[[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]* feature.

  Thanks to the removal of these less popular applications in 3.14 and the removal
  of some language packs in 3.13.2, Tails 3.14 is 39 MB smaller than 3.13.

Code
====

- We spent lots of time dealing with the Firefox add-ons fiasco,
  also known as "armagadd-on 2.0". [[!tails_ticket 16694]]

Documentation and website
=========================

- We explained better what are [[captive
  portals|/doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser]].

- We documented how to install additional [[language packs and
  dictionaries|doc/first_steps/additional_software#language-packs]].

- We replaced the PNG of the pie chart that we have on "[[How we spend
  our money|donate#expenses]]" with [pure SVG code, directly in the
  HTML](https://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/wiki/src/donate.html#n464).
  It makes it lighter to download, more accessible and much easier to
  update and translate.
