Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|bugfix|emergency] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We spent lots of time dealing with the Firefox add-ons fiasco,
  also known as "armagadd-on 2.0". [[!tails_ticket 16694]]

Documentation and website
=========================

XXX: If you feel like it and technical writers don't do it
     themselves, explore the Git history:

         git log --patch --since='1 October' --until='1 November' origin/master -- "*.*m*"

- We explained better what are [[captive
  portals|/doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser]].

- We documented how to install additional [[language packs and
  dictionaries|doc/first_steps/additional_software#language-packs]].

- We replaced the PNG of the pie chart that we have on "[[How we spend
  our money|donate#expenses]]" with [pure SVG code, directly in the
  HTML](https://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/wiki/src/donate.html#n464).
  It makes it lighter to download, more accessible and much easier to
  update and translate.
