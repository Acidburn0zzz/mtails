Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We successfully collaborated with the _Tor Browser_ team to fix
  a severe issue with _Tor Browser_ 8.0 in Tails, that was discovered
  shortly before the Tails 3.9 release. Thanks a lot for everyone
  who helped!

- We fixed a number of regressions that were introduced in Tails 3.9, such as:
  - Fix the update of *Additional Software*. ([[!tails_ticket 15978]])
  - Fix opening VeraCrypt file containers using the **Open With Unlock VeraCrypt
    Volumes** of *GNOME Files*. ([[!tails_ticket 15954]])
  - Fix the display of the **General** tab in the preferences of *Tor Browser*.
    ([[!tails_ticket 15917]])
  - Fix displaying the help of *GNOME Videos*. ([[!tails_ticket 15841]])

Documentation and website
=========================

XXX: If you feel like it and technical writers don't do it
     themselves, explore the Git history:

         git log --patch --since='1 October' --until='1 November' origin/master -- "*.*m*"

User experience
===============

XXX: If you feel like it and the UX team does not do it
     themselves, check the archives of tails-ux:
     <https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/>

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

XXX: Ask tails-bugs@boum.org to list hot topics for the last month.

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

- We started planning the migration of our Redmine to [[!tails_ticket
  15918 desc="a different hostname"]] and [[!tails_ticket 15919
  desc="a new VM"]].

- We wrote a number of automated tests to ensure we notice important
  regressions in the _VeraCrypt_ support introduced in Tails 3.9.

- We completed our [[!tails_ticket 14585 desc="investigation"]] of
  Dogtail's long-term viability. Our conclusion is that we can keep
  using it, should start contributing to the maintenance of the
  package in Debian, but invest as little as possible into Dogtail
  for now as our long-term concerns are not fully addressed.

- We investigated what prevented us from giving more Tails developers
  access to our Jenkins CI platform so far. We've identified
  a [[!tails_ticket 11344 desc="few"]] [[!tails_ticket 15981
  desc="blockers"]], resolved them, and started giving such access
  more liberally, which should make Tails development work more
  pleasurable and efficient for a few more people.

- The Tails sysadmin team discussed hiring a new team member, the
  profile of the person we will be looking for, and how we could share
  our work with them.

- We made great progress towards [[!tails_ticket 14588 desc="hosting
  our website on our own infrastructure"]]. The final steps and migration
  should happen by the end of the year.

Funding
=======

- We published our [[finances for 2017|doc/about/finances#2017]].

XXX: The fundraising team should look at the fundraising Git.

       git log --patch --since='1 December' --until='1 January' origin/master
