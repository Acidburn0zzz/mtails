Releases
========

   
Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

- We updated our roadmap, listing our [[priorities for the next
  years|blueprint/roadmap]].

- Use a dedicated homepage for *Tor Browser* in Tails to be able to
  customize what we are showing when people start Tails ([[!tails_ticket 11725]]).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We documented how to [[install *Tails Installer* in Ubuntu
  16.04|install/debian/usb#ubuntu]] ([[!tails_ticket 11570]]).
  Unfortunately, this has to be done on the command line since *Tails
  Installer* is not listed in the new *Ubuntu Software* yet. But we are
  working on fixing this ([[!tails_ticket 11569]]).
- We finally documented how to use the different fields of our 
  [[bugtracker|/contribute/working_together/Redmine/#fields]]. 
  This took a while, but led to several nice discussions on the mailing list
  meanwhile and helped to make the process more clear.
- We worked with Monkeysign on documenting it for Tails and for the new documentation
  website of Monkeysign itself.

User experience
===============

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

* XXX ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure. XXX=ask tails-sysadmins@boum.org
