Code

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We have coordinated with the _Tor Browser_ team wrt. the scope and
  timeline of upcoming big changes that will impact our work.

  a longstanding bug: `persistence.conf` sometimes becomes empty.

  _Etcher_. [[!tails_ticket 16381]]
