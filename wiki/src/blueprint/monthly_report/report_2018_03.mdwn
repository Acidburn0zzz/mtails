Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

- Our OpenPGP Applet homepage, previously hosted on [Alioth](https://openpgp-applet.alioth.debian.org) has been moved to Alioth's successor, [Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org). The address is now [https://openpgp-applet-team.pages.debian.net](), and the project (code repository and issue tracker) is reachable at [https://salsa.debian.org/openpgp-applet-team/openpgp-applet](), continuing the project of upstreaming this code so that you can use it outside of Tails. Also, version 1.1 as been released, fixing some long-standing bugs.

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

XXX: If you feel like it and technical writers don't do it
     themselves, explore the Git history:

         git log --patch --since='1 October' --until='1 November' origin/master -- "*.*m*"

User experience
===============

XXX: If you feel like it and the UX team does not do it
     themselves, check the archives of tails-ux:
     <https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/>

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================



1. The most annoying hot topic of the month is without any doubt that [[Automatic upgrades from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2 are not working|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15485]]

2. Several users also complained about [[Tails Installer failing|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15432]]

3. And there seems to be more people complaining about [[loosing their Persistent Volume|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10976]] than usual.

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

- We've worked on a more detailed scheme to include our web translation
  platform into our workflow [[!tails_ticket 10034]].

Funding
=======

- We submitted again our proposal for the work on [[distributing USB
  images|blueprint/usb_install_and_upgrade]] to the [NLnet call for
  funding](nlhttps://nlnet.nl/news/2018/20180401-call-en.html).

- We participated in the [DuckDuckGo Privacy
  Challenge](https://www.crowdrise.com/duckduckgoprivacychallenge). We
