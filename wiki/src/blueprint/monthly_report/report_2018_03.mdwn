Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

- The homepage for our *OpenPGP Applet*, previously hosted on [Alioth](https://openpgp-applet.alioth.debian.org) has been moved to Alioth's successor, [Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org). The address is now <https://openpgp-applet-team.pages.debian.net> and the project (code repository and issue tracker) is reachable at <https://salsa.debian.org/openpgp-applet-team/openpgp-applet>, continuing the project of upstreaming this code so that you can use it outside of Tails. Also, version 1.1 as been released, fixing some long-standing bugs.

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We released [*Tails Verification*
  1.0](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tails-verification/)
  with some minor improvements from an expert review, updated jQuery and
  Forge libraries, and a fixed the download link on retry.

  We also [[documented the security aspects of *Tails
  Verification*|contribute/design/verification_extension#inside_the_browser]].

Documentation and website
=========================

We documented how to:

- [[Save the configuration of your
  displays|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#displays]] if you have
  more than one display (for example, two monitors or a projector).

- [[Reproduce a bug in Debian|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting#debian]]
  when reporting an error (for advanced users).

- [[Use *Tails Installer* to do a manual upgrade from
  3.5|upgrade/tails#3.5]] in languages other than English.

We also made the [[output of the GnuPG command line to verify an ISO
image|install/download#openpgp]] more consistent across different
versions of GnuPG.

User experience
===============

- From a session at the Internet Freedom Festival, we took notes on how
  [[participants used the metaphor of a tent to describe
  Tails|blueprint/explain_tails#iff]]:

  - It's *portable*: you can store it in your backpack.
  - It's *amnesic*: it's empty every time you set it up.
  - It's *incognito*: you can move it around and it look like other tents.

- We started discussing a collaboration with [Simply
  Secure](https://simplysecure.org/) to explain better what is Tails.
  The goals are both to reach a consensus among contributors and to make
  it easier to explain Tails to the world.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. The most annoying hot topic of the month is without any doubt that [[Automatic upgrades from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2 are not working|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15485]]

2. Several users also complained about [[Tails Installer failing|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15432]]

3. And there seems to be more people complaining about [[loosing their Persistent Volume|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10976]] than usual.

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

- We've worked on a more detailed scheme to include our web translation
  platform into our workflow [[!tails_ticket 10034]].

- We documented our [[survey
  platform|contribute/how/user_experience/limesurvey]].

Funding
=======

- We submitted again our proposal for the work on [[distributing USB
  images|blueprint/usb_install_and_upgrade]] to the [NLnet call for
  funding](nlhttps://nlnet.nl/news/2018/20180401-call-en.html).

- We participated in the [DuckDuckGo Privacy
  Challenge](https://www.crowdrise.com/duckduckgoprivacychallenge). We
  raised $4 235 and rank 5th on March 28.

  You can help us win one of the prizes given out by DuckDuckGo (summit
  up to $500 000) by [donating to our
