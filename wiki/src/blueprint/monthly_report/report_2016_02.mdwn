A friendlier build system
-------------------------

For years Tails has offered a
[[build system based on Vagrant|contribute/build/#index2h1]], which at
times has been maintained and really easy to use, and so a great
resource for new contributors that want to test their
modifications. Sadly that was a while ago, mostly because all but one
Tails developers have been using their own custom build systems. The
main reason for that is that Vagrant uses Virtualbox by default, while
all of us (and our infrastructure, e.g. our Jenkins automated builds
and tests setup) greatly prefer the QEMU/KVM stack (and libvirt), and
it is not possible to mix two hypervisors at the same time.

But this is about to change! Recently there's been quite an effort to
[[!tails_ticket 6354 desc="migrate to vagrant-libvirt and the QEMU/KVM hypervisor"]]
which should allow all of us to converge to the same build
system. Besides saving development time since only one system has to
be maintained, it also means that this build system will be
well-maintained in the future, and so remain easy-to-use for
contributors.

There are a few roadblocks still, though, but you can help, especially
if you are a Debian developer! Currently we need vagrant-libvirt (and
ruby-fog-libvirt) packaged and maintained in Debian, and
[quite a lot of work](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=753012)
has already been done on that front. And to have the build system
working on Debian Jessie we need the following packages backported:
vagrant, ruby-excon, ruby-fog-core and ruby-fog-xml. If you want to
help, please get in touch with us on the
[tails-dev@boum.org public mailing list](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-dev/)!

Documentation and website
=========================

* The blueprint for [[Porting Tails to Debian Stretch|blueprint/Debian_Stretch]] has been updated.

* Multiple commits where made to speed up the build process of the website


User experience
===============

- We are working on replacing Vidalia (which has been unmaintained for years) with: (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 6841]])
   * the Tor Status GNOME Shell extension, which adds a System Status
   * [Onion Circuits] (https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/onioncircuits), a simple Tor circuit monitoring tool.

* Hide "Laptop Mode Tools Configuration" menu entry. We don't support configuring l-m-t in Tails, and it doesn't work out of the box. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11074]])

* There is now a blueprint for [[Porting Tails Installer to OS X|blueprint/Port_Tails_Installer_to_OS_X/]]

* We're now also publishing torrents for betas and RCs (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11126]])

Infrastructure
==============

* The ISO build system has been [upgraded to jessie](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-February/010323.html)

* Our test suite covers 208 scenarios

* In February XXX ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure.
