Code
====

- Most of the changes for Tails 3.6 [have been merged](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&set_filter=1&f%5B%5D=fixed_version_id&op%5Bfixed_version_id%5D=%3D&v%5Bfixed_version_id%5D%5B%5D=307&f%5B%5D=status_id&op%5Bstatus_id%5D=%3D&v%5Bstatus_id%5D%5B%5D=11&v%5Bstatus_id%5D%5B%5D=3&f%5B%5D=&c%5B%5D=priority&c%5B%5D=subject&c%5B%5D=cf_15&c%5B%5D=cf_18&group_by=category&t%5B%5D=) on Tails 3.6rc~1, and [[wide testing will be needed|https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/testing/]]. (hint: check out the [[!tails_ticket 5684 desc="Screen Locker"]]).


XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

Our website can be read in Spanish again, after some years in which the translation was discontinued. We thank all translators for their efforts!

XXX: If you feel like it and technical writers don't do it
     themselves, explore the Git history:

         git log --patch --since='1 October' --until='1 November' origin/master -- "*.*m*"

- We improved our [[installation instructions for Windows|install/win/usb]] to
  prevent people from skipping the *Fat32 Format* option of *Universal USB
  Installer*.

- We fixed our [[installation instructions for
  Ubuntu|install/debian/usb]] after the removal of the splash screen of
  *Tails Installer*.

User experience
===============

- We rethought in depth the installation process and made plans to [[distribute
  *USB images*|blueprint/usb_install_and_upgrade]] in addition to *ISO images*.
  Doing so will drastically simplify the installation for Windows and macOS
  and improve support for UEFI computers.

- We simplified the [[manual upgrade instructions from Tails|upgrade/tails]] to
  remove a whole step. Doing a manual upgrade should now be less confusing and
  take half the time!

- We [designed an error message](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2018-February/003531.html)
  when Tails is incompatible with a given graphics card. It will help users
  understand the failure better and get better help from our help desk.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================


1. Users are still complaining about [[Electrum being outdated|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15022]]

2. A lot of reports are about the [[Tails Installer Unicode issue|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15254]]


Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

Funding
=======

XXX: The fundraising team should look at the fundraising Git.

       git log --patch --since='1 December' --until='1 January' origin/master

XXX: The fundraising and accounting teams should look at the archives of <tails-fundraising@boum.org> and <tails-accounting@boum.org>.

- We submitted a proposal for our work on [[distributing USB
  images|blueprint/usb_install_and_upgrade]] to the [ISC Project's 2018 Round
  of Small Technology Grants](https://iscproject.org/the-isc-projects-2018-round-of-small-technology-grants/).

- We renewed the agreement what have with Tor for them to pay for the hosting
  of our main server.
