Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We wrote a new page to list [[known issues with graphics
  cards|support/known_issues/graphics]]. Combined with the better error message
  when GDM fails to start that we introduced in [[Tails 3.6|news/version_3.6]],
  it should gradually improve a lot the experience of people who cannot start
  Tails with their graphics card.

User experience
===============

- We started designing a [quantitative survey of our user
  base](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2018-April/003540.html).

  What would be useful for us to know about our users?

- We drafted a [[fourth persona skeleton|personas#derya]].

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================


1. Users are still affected by [[a loss of persistence.conf|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10976]]


1. We received also a several reports about [[keyboard and mouse not working after upgrading|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14754]]


1. A few users reported the [[disappearance of a part of their keyring|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15014]]

1. And some users had [[trouble with obfs4 bridges|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15548]]

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

- We documented our [[LimeSurvey
  installation|contribute/how/user_experience/limesurvey]].

Funding

  in donations and will receive $33&thinsp;000 in prizes from DuckDuckGo.

  Thanks a lot to everybody who participated!
