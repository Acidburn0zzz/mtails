Releases
========

There have been no releases in April.

* Tails 3.7 is [[scheduled for May 8|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

* We kept working with upstream to be able to [support VeraCrypt in GNOME](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/pull/495).

* jvoisin has been working also on the next MAT: [MAT2](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2). Lots of improvements, will come with support for new formats and more.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We wrote a new page to list [[known issues with graphics
  cards|support/known_issues/graphics]]. Combined with the better error message
  when GDM fails to start that we introduced in [[Tails 3.6|news/version_3.6]],
  it should gradually improve a lot the experience of people who cannot start
  Tails with their graphics card.

- We merged the former /install/os into [[/install|install]] to
  streamline a bit more our installation instructions.

- We changed the style of the purple headers that we had on our homepage
  to look less like buttons. We're now consistently using green for
  clickable elements and purple for non-clickable elements.

User experience
===============

- We started designing a [quantitative survey of our user
  base](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2018-April/003540.html).

  What would be useful for us to know about our users?

- We drafted a [[fourth persona skeleton|personas#derya]].

- We removed the zooming effect on the screenshots in our installation
  instructions which was annoying. ([[!tails_ticket 14678]])

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================


1. Users are still affected by [[a loss of persistence.conf|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10976]]


1. We received also a several reports about [[keyboard and mouse not working after upgrading|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14754]]


1. A few users reported the [[disappearance of a part of their keyring|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15014]]

1. And some users had [[trouble with obfs4 bridges|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15548]]

Infrastructure
==============

- We documented our [[LimeSurvey
  installation|contribute/how/user_experience/limesurvey]].

Funding
=======

- We participated in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Challenge. We raised $9&thinsp;870
  in donations and will receive $33&thinsp;000 in prizes from DuckDuckGo.

  Thanks a lot to everybody who participated!
