Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|bugfix] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We continued working on releasing Tails using a disk image format.
  This will make it easier to install Tails on Windows and macOS. Part
  of this work was to switch our IDF format to JSON and to rewrite and
  [release a new version of the Tails verification
  extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tails-verification/gaghffbplpialpoeclgjkkbknblfajdl).

- Updated onionshare, torsocks and tails-installer in Debian.

- hefee and emmapeel have continued working on integrating the
  translation platform into our infrastructure. We also made plans for
  finalizing this work.

Infrastructure
==============

- We planned the final steps to make our web translation platform
  production-ready.

- We kept working on our new server backup setup, which now works
  fine in production.

- Our mailing lists were migrated to new providers (puscii,
  Autistici/Inventati, and some self-hosted on our own
  infrastructure). Many thanks to boum.org for the support in the last
  ten years. Thanks as well to puscii and Austistici/Inventati for
  stepping up now.

- We started running the authoritative nameserver for a couple Tails
  DNS zones.

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

Funding
=======

We continued working on our yearly donation campaign:

* We added support for [[4 new cryptocurrencies|news/new_cryptocurrencies]].

* We wrote about [[our plans for 2019|news/plans_for_2019]].

* We raised 56k€ which is 47% of our goal.

Outreach

Past events
