Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|bugfix|emergency] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

- Preparations for Tails 4.0, based on Debian 10 "Buster"

   - Decreased by 200-300 MiB the amount of memory used by Tails
     ([[!tails_ticket 12092]]).
   - Fixed a regression that made the login process slower than in
     Tails 3.x ([[!tails_ticket 16805]]).
   - Many other fixes — thanks to everyone who tried Tails 4.0~beta1
     and gave us feedback!

- Test suite improvements

   - We fixed a number of issues that lead our test suite to report
     false positives ([[!tails_ticket 11592]], [[!tails_ticket
     17004]], [[!tails_ticket 15321]]).
   - Use a more recent Dogtail, run it with Python 3, and take benefit
     from the new UTF-8 support ([[!tails_ticket 16976]]).

- New automated tests

   - Installing Tails from a USB image with GNOME Disks ([[!tails_ticket 16004]])
   - VeraCrypt PIM feature ([[!tails_ticket 15946]])

- We made good progress on persisting a seed for the [[!wikipedia
  Pseudorandom number generator]] across boots ([[!tails_ticket
  11897]]). There's now a good chance that this work is included
  in a Tails release by the end of the year.

- We completed the first iteration of our effort to [[tails_ticket
  7036 desc="move the source code for our custom software to our main
  Git repository"]]: the Greeter [[!tails_ticket 16912 desc="was
  migrated"]]. This will avoid quite some busywork, make it easier to
  contribute to the affected code bases, and increase the value of our
  reproducible builds, by removing some binary blobs from our set of
  _de facto_ trusted inputs.
