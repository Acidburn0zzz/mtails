Releases
========

* [[Tails 2.6 was released on September 20|news/version_2.6]] (major release).
  The release candidate was online on September 3rd. Thanks to everybody for testing!

* Tails 2.7 is [[scheduled for November 8|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.6:

  - We enabled [[!wikipedia address space layout randomization]] in the Linux
    kernel (`kASLR`) to improve protection from buffer overflow attacks.

  - We installed [[`rngd`|contribute/design/random#rngd]] to improve the
    entropy of the random numbers generated on computers that have
    a hardware random number generator.

  - Install firmware for Intel SST sound cards (`firmware-intel-sound`), and Texas
    Instruments Wi-Fi interfaces (`firmware-ti-connectivity`).

  - Remove `non-free` APT repositories. We documented how to [[configure
    additional APT repositories|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software#repository]]
    using the persistent volume.

  - Use a dedicated page as the homepage of *Tor Browser* so we can customize
    it for our users (Although the content of the website is still the same!)

  - Set up the trigger for RAM erasure on shutdown earlier in the boot
    process. This should speed up shutdown and make RAM erasure more robust.

  - Disable the automatic configuration of *Icedove* when using [[!wikipedia OAuth]].
    This should fix the automatic configuration for GMail accounts. ([[!tails_ticket 11536]])

  - Make the *Disable all networking* and *Tor bridge mode* options of *Tails
    Greeter* more robust. ([[!tails_ticket 11593]])


Code

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

Tor ControlPort filter improvements and OnionShare integration
--------------------------------------------------------------

These two things might seem unrelated but are mentioned together
because the work on the latter required the former. The tl;dr is of
this section is: users can expect OnionShare in Tails 2.8, and perhaps
Tor Browser's per-tab circuit view will be enabled as well.

Background: Tor's ControlPort has a rather large attack surface
in case of a compromise as it exposes sensitive information and
allows reconfiguring Tor to drastically reduce its
effectiveness. However some applications require access to (some
subset of) it to improve the user experience in very real ways,
like showing which circuits are used for a tab in the Tor
Browser, or for OnionShare to tell Tor to start the hidden
service used to share files. The solution we've used in Tails has
been to give most users access to a filtered version of the Tor
ControlPort, which only expose "safe" commands.

This filter has been very simplistic until now, as it essentially
only exposed the `SIGNAL NEWNYM` command, to make Tor use new
circuits. Because of the complexity to support
events (asynchronisity) and [[!tails_ticket 9365 desc="potential
security concerns of exposing Tor's stream/circuit state"]] we
for instance disabled the per-tab circuit view in Tor Browser,
and were forced to run onioncircuits as a separate user (than the
normal `amnesia` user) with full access to the Tor ControlPort.
Notably, it could not support OnionShare, and in fact had
architectural-level limitations (e.g. not being able to handle
multiple sessions at the same time).

Now [the filter](http://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/tor-controlport-filter?h=feature/7870-include_onionshare)
solves all these problems, and more. Depending on
the PID of the client (e.g. OnionShare) it will pick a filter
[defined (by us)](http://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/tor-controlport-filter.d/onionshare.yml?h=feature/7870-include_onionshare)
specifically for that application. For instance,
we can say that "this $user (e.g. `amnesia`) when running this
$application (e.g. `/usr/bin/onionshare`) can only run these
commands (`ADD_ONION` etc.) and listen to these
events (e.g. `HS_DESC`, which is expected after a successfull use
of `ADD_ONION`)". This makes user-separation (which has UX
issues, like loss of accessibility support, and adds to code complexity)
an obsolete security
measure, and to benefit from it clients have to do nothing.

So now we can expect (not 100% sure though!) OnionShare to be
introduced in Tails 2.8, and with much improved security on the
ControlPort filtering. Probably we'll also see TorBrowser's
per-tab circuit view enabled in Tails, finally.

It should be noted that: there is at least one other project that
already has implemented this functionality,
[Subgraph](https://subgraph.com/) with its
[roflcoptor](https://github.com/subgraph/roflcoptor), which we
probably should have put our efforts at instead, but let's say
that it is our long-term goal on this front. At least our users
will be able to enjoy these features in Tails much sooner, which
is great in itself.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We published our [[roadmap for 2016-2017|contribute/roadmap]].

- We designed a new [[donation page|donate]] which proposes
  tax-deducible donations in both euros, through Zwieblefreunde and
  dollars, through RiseupLabs.

- We documented how we use the different fields of our
  [[bugtracker|/contribute/working_together/Redmine/#fields]].
  This took a while, but led to several nice discussions on the mailing list
  meanwhile and helped to make the process more clear.

- We worked with Monkeysign on documenting it for Tails and for the new documentation
  website of Monkeysign itself.

- We made the [[overview pages of the
  installation|install/debian/usb/overview]] assistant more compact.

User experience
===============

Infrastructure
==============

* 404 ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure.

Funding
=======

  - We prepared a donation campaign that we will roll out in early
    October.

  - We submitted a proposal for
    [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/request/) to fund coding sprint
    on porting Tails to Debian Stretch.

  - We added a [[!tails_ticket 11726 desc="footer on the answers of our help desk"]] to encourage the people that we are helping to contribute to its cost.

On-going discussions
====================

[[September 2016 online meeting minutes|contribute/meetings/201609]].
