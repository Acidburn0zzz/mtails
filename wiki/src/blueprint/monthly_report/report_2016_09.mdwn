Releases
========
* [[Tails 2.6 was released on September 20|news/version_2.6]] (major release).

* Tails 2.7 is [[scheduled for November 8|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.6:

  - We enabled [[!wikipedia address space layout randomization]] in the Linux
    kernel (`kASLR`) to improve protection from buffer overflow attacks.
 
  - We installed [[`rngd`|contribute/design/random#rngd]] to improve the
    entropy of the random numbers generated on computers that have
    a hardware random number generator.
 
 
  - Install firmware for Intel SST sound cards (`firmware-intel-sound`).
 
  - Install firmware for Texas Instruments Wi-Fi interfaces (`firmware-ti-connectivity`).
 
  - Remove `non-free` APT repositories. We documented how to [[configure
    additional APT repositories|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software#repository]]
    using the persistent volume.
 
  - Use a dedicated page as the homepage of *Tor Browser* so we can customize
    it for our users.

  - Set up the trigger for RAM erasure on shutdown earlier in the boot
    process. This should speed up shutdown and make RAM erasure more robust.
      
  - Disable the automatic configuration of *Icedove* when using [[!wikipedia OAuth]].
    This should fix the automatic configuration for GMail accounts. ([[!tails_ticket 11536]])
    
  - Make the *Disable all networking* and *Tor bridge mode* options of *Tails
    Greeter* more robust. ([[!tails_ticket 11593]])
