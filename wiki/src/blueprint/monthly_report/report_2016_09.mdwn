Releases
========

* [[Tails 2.6 was released on September 20|news/version_2.6]] (major release).
  The release candidate was online on September 3rd. Thanks to everybody for testing!

* Tails 2.7 is [[scheduled for November 8|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.6:

  - We enabled [[!wikipedia address space layout randomization]] in the Linux
    kernel (`kASLR`) to improve protection from buffer overflow attacks.

  - We installed [[`rngd`|contribute/design/random#rngd]] to improve the
    entropy of the random numbers generated on computers that have
    a hardware random number generator.

  - Install firmware for Intel SST sound cards (`firmware-intel-sound`), and Texas
    Instruments Wi-Fi interfaces (`firmware-ti-connectivity`).

  - Remove `non-free` APT repositories. We documented how to [[configure
    additional APT repositories|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software#repository]]
    using the persistent volume.

  - Use a dedicated page as the homepage of *Tor Browser* so we can customize
    it for our users (Although the content of the website is still the same!)

  - Set up the trigger for RAM erasure on shutdown earlier in the boot
    process. This should speed up shutdown and make RAM erasure more robust.

  - Disable the automatic configuration of *Icedove* when using [[!wikipedia OAuth]].
    This should fix the automatic configuration for GMail accounts. ([[!tails_ticket 11536]])

  - Make the *Disable all networking* and *Tor bridge mode* options of *Tails
    Greeter* more robust. ([[!tails_ticket 11593]])


Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We published our [[roadmap for 2016-2017|contribute/roadmap]].

- We designed a new [[donation page|donate]] which proposes
  tax-deducible donations in both euros, through Zwieblefreunde and
  dollars, through RiseupLabs.

- We documented how we use the different fields of our
  [[bugtracker|/contribute/working_together/Redmine/#fields]].
  This took a while, but led to several nice discussions on the mailing list
  meanwhile and helped to make the process more clear.

- We worked with Monkeysign on documenting it for Tails and for the new documentation
  website of Monkeysign itself.

- We made the [[overview pages of the
  installation|install/debian/usb/overview]] assistant more compact.

User experience
===============

Infrastructure
==============

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

* 404 ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure.

Funding
=======

  - We prepared a donation campaign that we will roll out in early
    October.

  - We submitted a proposal for
    [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/request/) to fund coding sprint
    on porting Tails to Debian Stretch.

XXX: Add the output of (adjust month!):

    git checkout $(git rev-list -n 1 --before="September 1" origin/master) && \
    git submodule update --init && \
    ./wiki/src/contribute/l10n_tricks/language_statistics.sh

Metrics
=======

* Tails has been started more than BOOTS/MONTH times this month. This makes BOOTS/DAY boots a day on average.
* SIGS downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO from our website.
* 119 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

XXX: Ask tails@boum.org for these numbers.
