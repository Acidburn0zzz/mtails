Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.10.1 was released on October 23rd|news/version_3.10.1]] ([bugfix] release).

* Tails 3.11 is [[scheduled for December 11th|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.10.1:

- Hide the [[**PIM** option|doc/encryption_and_privacy/veracrypt#parameters]]
  when unlocking *VeraCrypt* volumes because *PIM* won't be supported until
  Tails 4.0. ([[!tails_ticket 16031]])

- Rename the buttons in the confirmation dialog of *Tails Installer* to
  **Install** (or **Upgrade**) and **Cancel** to be less confusing.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11501]])

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

We finalized our work on the Additional Software Feature. Small
bugfixes will be shipped in the next release.

We are very proud that our work to decrypt VeraCrypt volumes has landed
in Gnome and is being included in other distributions, as mentioned in
the [release announcement of Ubuntu Cosmic
Cuttlefish](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/10/19/welcome-ubuntu-desktop-18-10).

Infrastructure
==============

- Following-up on a process started in September, we were able to give
  more Tails developers access to our Jenkins CI platform. This should
  make their work more pleasurable and efficient.

- We made great progress on our new [[!wikipedia DIY]] low-power
  backup server. We received the hardware, had great fun with Dremel
  tools and epoxy resin to make everything fit into the case, and
  finally installed the operating system. And what aboutâ€¦ pictures?
  [Here they are!](https://pics.puscii.nl/index.php?/category/120-stone) :)

- We did most of the work that will allow us to remove the outdated
  Gitolite instance we run on one of our systems. ([[!tails_ticket 14587]])

- We ordered new drives to expand the storage capacity of our main
  server. ([[!tails_ticket 16041]])

XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

We launched our [[yearly donation campaign|/news/2018-fundraiser/]].
