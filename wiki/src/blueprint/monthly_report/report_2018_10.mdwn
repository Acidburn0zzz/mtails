Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.10.1 was released on October 23rd|news/version_3.10.1]] ([bugfix] release).

* Tails 3.11 is [[scheduled for December 11th|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.10.1:

- Hide the [[**PIM** option|doc/encryption_and_privacy/veracrypt#parameters]]
  when unlocking *VeraCrypt* volumes because *PIM* won't be supported until
  Tails 4.0. ([[!tails_ticket 16031]])

- Rename the buttons in the confirmation dialog of *Tails Installer* to
  **Install** (or **Upgrade**) and **Cancel** to be less confusing.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11501]])

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

We finalized our work on the Additional Software feature. Small
bugfixes will be shipped in the next release.

We are very proud that our work to unlock VeraCrypt volumes has landed
in GNOME and is being included in other distributions, as mentioned in
the [release announcement of Ubuntu Cosmic
Cuttlefish](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/10/19/welcome-ubuntu-desktop-18-10).

Distributing USB images
-----------------------

We started working on [[distributing USB
images|usb_install_and_upgrade/usb_bootable_disk_image]] which will make
installing Tails much easier on Windows and macOS:

- We have a first version of the code to transform ISO images into USB
  images ([[!tails_ticket 15293]]).

- We wrote the instructions to install an USB image on Debian using GNOME Disks
  ([[!tails_ticket 15659]]) and Windows ([[!tails_ticket 15808]]) and macOS
  ([[!tails_ticket 15809]]) using Etcher.

This work will be released in Tails 3.12 (January 29).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We updated our [[!tails_roadmap desc="roadmap"]] for the next 2 years.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Several users reported [[!tails_ticket 15978]], Keyboard and mouse do
   not work after upgrading to tails 3.2, but that was fixed in Tails
   3.10.1.

1. Many users are suffering from [[!tails_ticket 14754]] and are unable
   to automatically install software on their persistence, sometimes
   after interrupting the upgrade process.

Infrastructure
==============

- Following-up on a process started in September, we were able to give
  more Tails developers access to our Jenkins CI platform. This should
  make their work more pleasurable and efficient.

- We made great progress on our new [[!wikipedia DIY]] low-power
  backup server. We received the hardware, had great fun with Dremel
  tools and epoxy resin to make everything fit into the case, and
  finally installed the operating system. And what aboutâ€¦ pictures?
  [Here they are!](https://pics.puscii.nl/index.php?/category/120-stone) :)

- We did most of the work that will allow us to remove the outdated
  Gitolite instance we run on one of our systems. ([[!tails_ticket 14587]])

- We ordered new drives to expand the storage capacity of our main
  server. ([[!tails_ticket 16041]])

Funding
=======

We launched our [[yearly donation campaign|/news/2018-fundraiser/]] and raised
18% of our goal in the first 2 weeks.
