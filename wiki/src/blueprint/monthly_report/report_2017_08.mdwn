XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

* intrigeri
  [started a discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/08/msg00090.html)
  about enabling AppArmor by default in Debian. So far the feedback
  has been good.
* We [[decided to evaluate|blueprint/Debian_testing]] this year
  whether we can base Tails on quarterly snapshots of Debian testing.
  If we end up answering this question favorably, then the first such
  release would happen early in 2018 (January or April).
* We worked on regressions introduced in Tails 3.0 that our Help Desk
  and Foundations Team deems high-priority, such as
  [[!tails_ticket 12733]] and [[!tails_ticket 13437]].
* We [[!tails_ticket 12707 desc="worked on Tails Installer"]] to make
  it create larger system partitions so that users can benefit more
  often from automatic upgrades, instead of having to perform
  a manual upgrade.
* We are in the process of [[!tails_ticket 8281 desc="evaluating"]]
  whether GNOME's on-screen keyboard could fully replace _Florence_.
* We started [[!tails_ticket 12732 desc="porting"]] Tails to Linux 4.12.
* We started organizing teams, work, timeline and workflow for our
  upcoming OTF contract:
  - [[!tails_ticket 14468 desc="VeraCrypt support in GNOME: make it easier to integrate Tails into workflows with other users and operating systems"]]
  - Additional software: make it easier to tailor Tails to specific
    needs for sensitive data manipulation ([[!tails_ticket 14568]],
    [[!tails_ticket 5551]] and friends)
