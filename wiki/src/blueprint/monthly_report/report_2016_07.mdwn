Releases
========

* There have been no releases in July.
* Tails 2.5 is [[scheduled for August 3|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

- Icedove: Tails' Icedove Apparmor profile has been accepted in Debian!
- DAVE: We have added new mirrors to our mirror pool, and soon we will update our Firefox Add-on with this [[!tails_ticket 11109 desc="code"]].
- Tails server: There is a lot of progress the GUI, there have been user testing, ephemeral hidden services are created now with stem, the code is integrated in Tails now, it is possible to reset the onion addresses, the application is translatable and there are [ISO images](http://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_feature-5688-tails-server/builds/) available for testing now! You can read more about this [here](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-July/010771.html) and [here](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-July/010797.html)
- We keep reducing our delta with upstream, now we have dropped the  custom value for kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl ([[!tails_ticket 11511]]).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We have documented how to get the source code of packages
  shipped in Tails ([[!tails_ticket 6311]]).
- That manual ISO build needs a HTTP proxy [[!tails_ticket 11046]].
- The monitoring service also has more documentation now: [[!tails_ticket 11366]].
- We have added Linux Mint instructions to our [[Installation Assistant|install/debian/usb]]: [[!tails_ticket 11561]].
- And also [[how to save KeePassX settings using Dotfiles|doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords]].

User experience
===============

- Two user tests have been done for Tails Server, with technical and non-technical users. More information on the results: [first](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-July/003254.html) and [second](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-July/003265.html)
- We have made some statistics about how quick our users update Tails. Most users update quickly, but there is still a 15% that update from Tails 4 months or older. 

Infrastructure
==============

- After a lot of work, we have finished implementing Tails servers
*monitoring system*! Read the [[sysadmins documentation|contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins/#icinga2]]
for details.
- We noticed that the apt-cacher-ng cache disk was filling up because of expired time-based snapshots. So we re-implemented our puppet modules to prevent this ([[!tails_ticket 11532]]).


XXX: Count the number of tests in /features at the beginning of next month

         git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="June 1" origin/devel`
         git grep --extended-regexp '^\s*Scenario:' -- features/*.feature | wc -l

* XXX ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure. XXX=ask tails-sysadmins@boum.org

Funding

We reevaluated the minimum yearly budget for Tails.
