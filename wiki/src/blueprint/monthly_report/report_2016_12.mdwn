Releases
========

* Tails 2.9 was cancelled due to CVE-2016-1252.
* [[Tails 2.9.1 was released on 12 14|news/version_2.9.1]] (minor release).

* Tails 2.10 is [[scheduled for 01 24|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.9.1:

* Switch to *DuckDuckGo* as the default search engine in *Tor Browser*.
  The previous default search engine, *Disconnect.me*, has already been
  redirecting to *Duck Duck Go* for some time.

Code
====

We've had a great sprint about porting Tails to Debian Stretch.
Most of our time was spent integrating the new Greeter as well as bug fixing,
polishing, and updating the test suite.

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.

* XXX ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure. XXX=ask tails-sysadmins@boum.org

  than 100000 â‚¬ in donations.

- The [[independent French investigative journal Mediapart has decided
  to support|news/mediapart]] Tails financially every year. Thank you
  very much!

- We submitted a concept note to OTF for 2017-2018.
