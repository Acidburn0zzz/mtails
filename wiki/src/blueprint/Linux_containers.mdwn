Background
==========

Tails currently [[uses only AppArmor for isolating
applications|contribute/design/application_isolation]].

User namespaces eventually made their way into the 3.8 kernel:
<https://lwn.net/Articles/531114/>.

Threat model
============

These are *potential* goals. It remains to be discussed which ones are
MUST, SHOULD, etc., which can vary depending on the
sandboxed application.

* filesystem isolation?
* X isolation? (e.g. key logging, taking pictures of the screen)
* network isolation?
* privilege escalation via holes in Linux?
* privilege escalation via already running privileged daemons, or
  setuid/setgid binaries?
* isolation from hardware?
  - sound: prevent sandboxed software from recording
  - identifiers: prevent sandboxed software from learning hardware
    identifiers, e.g. the MAC address; probably hard to achieve, since
    containers share the host's kernel

Security limitations
====================

* Until we can use Ubuntu's AppArmor profiles for LXC in Debian (most
  notably, the mount mediation support is missing), privileged
  containers still [seem to be
  unsafe](https://www.stgraber.org/2014/01/01/lxc-1-0-security-features/).
* [Unprivileged
  containers](https://www.stgraber.org/2014/01/17/lxc-1-0-unprivileged-containers/)
  should be enough for most of what we intend to contain. It's unclear
  if they can be made to work on Debian Wheezy (seems to require quite
  some backporting work). Note, however, that unprivileged containers
  have had quite some security issues when they were introduced (and
  for this reason, the grsec patchset disables unprivileged use of
  user namespaces). Have things gotten better since?


Tools to manage containers
==========================

* LXC
* `unshare(1)`
* [pflask](https://github.com/ghedo/pflask) automates the creation of
  simple Linux containers based on them; it is e.g. used by
  [pflask-debuild](https://github.com/ghedo/pflask/blob/master/tools/pflask-debuild)
* systemd-nspawn
* Docker, that we're [[evaluating|blueprint/evaluate_Docker]] as
  a candidate to replace Vagrant in our easy build system

Running GUI applications in containers
======================================

<a id="oz"></a>

## Subgraph's Oz

* [Oz](https://github.com/subgraph/oz) is a sandboxing system targeting
  everyday workstation applications. It relies mainly on Xpra and
  Linux namespaces.
* See its [technical
  documentation](https://github.com/subgraph/oz/wiki/Oz-Technical-Details)
  for details.
* It has a [GNOME Shell
  extension](https://github.com/subgraph/ozshell-gnome-extension) that
  e.g. allows one to add files to a running sandbox.
* Sandboxed applications can optionally be given access to:
  - files passed on their command line, which makes them work just
    fine when started e.g. from a file manager or a web browser;
  - the microphone and/or speaker, thanks to Xpra.
* Potential functionality limitations and UX issues:
  - It's not clear to me how things such as printing, Orca and IBus
    input methods are handled. For the two latter ones, access to the
    session D-Bus is needed, so presumably making these work will
    require mediating D-Bus calls, as done e.g. in AppArmor on Ubuntu.
  - When one has already started e.g. LibreOffice and needs to open
    a new file, they need to first use the GNOME Shell extension to
    add it to the sandbox; in this respect, the resulting UX seems to
    be inferior to the one the designs the AppArmor and `xdg-app`
    folks mean to implement (file chooser with a privileged backend).
