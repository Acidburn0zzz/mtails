[[!meta title="Tails report for April, 2015"]]

This report is a bit special: since we release every 6 weeks, there is no release this month. The next one is [[planned for the 12th of May|contribute/calendar]]. Therefore there are no code news, the work being done will be reported when it's released :)

However, like any Free Software project, Tails is not only about the code, so here are the news about the other parts of the project!

[[!toc ]]

Documentation and website
=========================

* We wrote a small documentation about [[*Claws Mail*|doc/anonymous_internet/claws_mail]].

* We corrected [[some|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/mac]] [[details|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/linux]] in the manual installation documentations, the [[verification documentation|/download#verify]], and [[related FAQ questions|support/faq#unetbootin_etc]].

* We added a [[FAQ entry about why we ship the GNOME Desktop|support/faq#gnome]].

* We added a [[FAQ entry about why we don't sell preinstalled Tails devices|support/faq#preinstalled]].

* We added (yet another) [[FAQ entry about why you shouldn't edit your torrc|support/faq#torrc]].

* ... and various small improvements to the documentation all over the place :)

User experience
===============

- On the [[ISO verification extension|blueprint/bootstrapping/extension]]:
  - We started a security discussion about the [possible threats **from
    inside the browser**](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-April/008648.html).
    We need your expertise!
  - We finished a [detailed
    wireframe](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/757/extension-20150429.fodg)
    of the various screens of the extension.

- On the [[web assistant for getting started with Tails|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]]:
  - We finished a [[prototype for the 3rd iteration of the
    router|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant/router/3rd_iteration/router-3rd-iteration.fodp]]
    (the set of introductory questions) and [[tested it with several
    people|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant/router/3rd_iteration/testing]].
  - We started a discussion about [several terminology
    issues](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-April/000370.html).
  - We proposed a [[URL scheme|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant#url]], a
    [[JavaScript policy|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant#javascript]],
    and a [[compatibility list for Mac|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant#mac]].

- We published some [[guidelines for user testing|contribute/how/user_interface/testing]].
