- Is a social science student in Hanoi.

- Is part of a group organizing a public massive protest against new
  government policies and laws.

- Is considered to be quite tech-savvy by others in their group though
  they never really studied computer science.

- Wants to be stealthy and anonymous, but the protest needs to be public
  and advertised.

- Their group needs to send out strategic information to the public so
  that citizens actually know where to show up.

- In order to publish this information, their group uses websites which

  cannot shut them down but these websites are censored within the
  country.

  pseudonymously with the international press or the Vietnamese diaspora
  (on social media, over email, etc.).

- During the protest, leaves their phones at home and use devices that
  are not theirs (burner phones, cameras, etc.), so that they can hide
  their involvement in the organization of this protest.

- After the protest, their group tries to publish text and images about
  the protest as soon as possible.

### Motivations

- Wants to lead social change in their country without being put
  themselves under the spotlight.

- Wants information to be free in their country: they want to speak
  freely and they want others to have access to uncensored information.

### Challenges and threats

- Use networks.

- Access information online.

- Use applications that the government is not monitoring.

- Use mesh applications.

- Help others access censored information; for example by teaching
  people anti-censorship technologies.

### Communications

- External communications: censored websites.

### Primary goal

#### E. I want information to be free

- I want to access censored information online
- I want to publish sensitive information

### Secondary goals

#### A. I want to hide information about myself
