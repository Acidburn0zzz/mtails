Pros & cons
===========

## Pros

* It is likely that cheap laptops are going to be more and more often
  based on ARM. So, supporting ARM would have several advantages:
  - People who can't afford a more expensive computer might more
    easily afford a ARM-based one ⇒ supporting Tails on ARM would make
    it more accessible economically speaking.
  - It could allow more people to dedicate a machine to Tails, which
    can have a number of advantages, such as: one can choose a machine
    that they can carry with them all the time (⇒ physical security of
    the hardware); one avoids the risk of their (adversary -owned)
    non-Tails operating system corrupting the firmware in a way that
    can in turn compromise Tails.

* Most mobile touch devices, e.g. tablets, are based on ARM
  these days ([[!tails_ticket 6064]]).

* Some concerns about (Intel) x86 technologies, like the Intel ME,
  might be less of a problem for the time being on ARM. This is no
  magic wand, though: as Joanna Rutkowska writes in her
  [State considered harmful](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/12/23/state_harmful.html)
  paper, "there is nothing special in ARM-based architecture that
  could prevent a vendor from introducing backdoors into the SoCs they
  produce".

## Cons

* A huge amount of work is needed to make this happen, since it
  impacts basically all kinds of teams and skills: user support,
  release process and workload, infrastructure, quality assurance,
  Installation Assistant + DAVE, etc.

* This has the potential to spread our energy a bit too thinly, e.g.
  in terms of maintenance workload, or in terms of acquiring
  maintaining and knowledge and skills.

* There are lots of unknowns: boot loaders, drivers and hardware
  support. It's an entirely new world for most of us ⇒ in the current
  state of things, it is hard to estimate the resources we would need
  to make it happen.

* Tor Browser [[!tor_bug 12631 desc="is not supported on ARM yet"]].

## Other remarks

* It might be a good thing, for the Tails project, to have a big thing
  to do together, that at least one people from each team would need
  to be somewhat involved in.

* The Tor project may be interested in supporting ARM platforms better
  (e.g. for Tor Browser). This could be a good opportunity to (learn
  how to) work together more tightly, be it on the technical or
  fundraising / paperwork side.
