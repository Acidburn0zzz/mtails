persistence or add an additional setting at Tails startup.

Nearly everything you can see! We worked for more than two years with designers
to redesign the greeter interface.

3.0~alpha1 ISO image including the revamped <span
class="application">Tails Greeter</span></a>

<div class="bug">

You cannot install Tails 3.0~alpha1 from Tails 2.x. It is impossible
as well to upgrade to Tails 3.0~alpha1 from Tails 2.x. So, either
install or upgrade from a non-Tails system, or start Tails 3.0~alpha1
from DVD and then clone it to a USB stick.

</div>

To install the test ISO, follow our usual [[installation instructions|install]],
skipping the **Download and verify** step.

## What to test

<span class="application">Tails Greeter</span> should show up after Tails boot:

Don't hesitate to test weird options, and verify they are taken into account in
the Tails session.

If you find anything that is not working as it should, please report to
us on <tails-testers@boum.org>.
