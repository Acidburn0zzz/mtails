Parent ticket: [[!tails_ticket 12328 desc="DAVE 2: Migrate to Web Extensions and support Chrome"]]

[[!toc]]

Scope
=====

With the port to Web Extension, we are:

- Adding a Chrome extension

Relevant threads:

- [Initial discussion on tails-ux](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-May/thread.html)
- [Decision on moving the download outside of DAVE](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-June/003394.html)

Goals:

- Make it easier to do a direct download for power users who do OpenPGP.
  - Proposed solution: Have a "Direct download" button and embed the
    OpenPGP instructions on the same page.

Wireframes

Made with [*WireframeSketcher*](http://wireframesketcher.com/) which is
proprietary but has a Debian package that works on Tails :)
