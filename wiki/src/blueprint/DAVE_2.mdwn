Parent ticket: [[!tails_ticket 12328 desc="DAVE 2: Migrate to Web Extensions and support Chrome"]]

[[!toc]]

Scope
=====

With the port to Web Extension, we are:

- Moving the download outside of DAVE
- Adding a Chrome extension

Relevant threads:

- [Initial discussion on tails-ux](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-May/thread.html)
- [Decision on moving the download outside of DAVE](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-June/003394.html)

Goals:

- Prevent people from using unverified ISO images.
  - Proposed solution: Split the download in a different step and adjust
    the "Next" link to what the user is doing on the page to discourage
    (but still make it possible) skipping the verification.
- Encourage BitTorrent download when DAVE is not supported.
  - Proposed solution: Explain better the benefits of BitTorrent and how
    to use it.
- Make it easier to do a direct download for power users who do OpenPGP.
  - Proposed solution: Have a "Direct download" button and embed the
    OpenPGP instructions on the same page.

Variations
==========

- 2 download techniques:
  - Direct download
  - BitTorrent download

- 3 verification techniques:
  - Browser add-on (Firefox, Chrome, or Tor Browser)
  - BitTorrent
  - OpenPGP (either on top of instead of the two others)

- 6 variations of the same screen depending on the browser:
  - Supported browser but no DAVE
  - Supported browser and DAVE already
  - Supported browser but outdated DAVE
  - Supported but outdated browser (eg. Firefox < 38)
  - Unsupported browser (eg. Internet Explorer)
  - Browser without JavaScript
