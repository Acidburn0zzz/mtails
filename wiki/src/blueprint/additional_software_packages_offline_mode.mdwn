This is about [[!tails_ticket 14570]] which we plan to implement for Tails 3.5.

# Current status

According to [[!tails_ticket 6260]] Additional Software Packages works offline for a dew days after being connected, but then fails.

The ticket suggests that the issue comes when the Release file corresponding to the packages to be installed is expired. This is controlled by the `Valid-Until` field of the Release file (<https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Date.2C_Valid-Until>). 

Looking at Valid-Until fields on Tails, it seems to be :

- ~1 week for unstable and stable/update
- ~1 month for torproject.org
- unlimited for stable

# Goal

Have Additional software packages to work offline forever, but to upgrade when connecting to the Internet

# Reproduction procedure

- start Tails online with persistence of apt packages and apt lists
- install curl (from stretch/updates) and wdiff (from stretch) and add them to additional software list
- reboot offline
- see if install works
- set the date 6 months in the future
- reboot offline
- see if install offline works

This procedure should now be tested

# Possible solutions

## Don't check Valid-Until on installation

Disable release file validity test on installation (Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false). We could test if we are offline before doing that. We would still do the validity check on upgrade.

## Apt-offline

## Local repository

Use a local repository to store the packages (e.g. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal). We control our Release file, but importing and upgrading the repository looks annoying.
