This is about [[!tails_ticket 14570]] which we plan to implement for Tails 3.5.

# Current status

According to [[!tails_ticket 6260]] Additional Software Packages works offline for a dew days after being connected, but then fails.

The ticket suggests that the issue comes when the Release file corresponding to the packages to be installed is expired. This is controlled by the `Valid-Until` field of the Release file (<https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Date.2C_Valid-Until>). 

Looking at Valid-Until fields on Tails, it seems to be :

- ~1 week for unstable and stable/update
- ~1 month for torproject.org
- unlimited for stable

# Goal

Have Additional software packages to work offline forever, but to upgrade when connecting to the Internet

# Reproduction procedure

I tried installing packages offline in Tails 3.3 using the following procedure on 14 Dec 2017:

* start Tails online with persistence of apt packages and apt lists
* install optipng (currently pulled from stretch/updates, which expires on 22 Dec 2017) and wdiff (from stretch, which doesn't expire) and add them to additional software list
* reboot offline
* the install works and optipng version is the one from stretch/updates
* set the date 1 year in the future in the BIOS
* reboot offline
* the install works and optipng version is the one from stretch/updates

I went through the entire procedure 3 times and got the same results. Basic offline operation is thus already working, and [[!tails_ticket 6260]] seems to be already resolved : recent APT doesn't check Valid-Until on package installation.

# Possible solutions

## Don't check Valid-Until on installation

Disable release file validity test on installation (Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false). We could test if we are offline before doing that. We would still do the validity check on upgrade.

## Apt-offline

## Local repository

Use a local repository to store the packages (e.g. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal). We control our Release file, but importing and upgrading the repository looks annoying.
