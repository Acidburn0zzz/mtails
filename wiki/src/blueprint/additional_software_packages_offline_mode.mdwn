This is about [[!tails_ticket 9059 desc="#14570"]] which we plan to implement for Tails 3.5.

# Current status

Additional Software Packages works offline for a dew days after being connected, but then fails.

I suppose that the issue comes when the Release file corresponding to the packages to be installed is expired. This is controlled by the `Valid-Until` field of the Release file (<https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Date.2C_Valid-Until>).

Looking at Valid-Until fields on Tails, it seems to be :

- ~1 week for unstable and stable/update
- ~1 month for torproject.org
- unlimited for stable

# Goal

Have Additional software packages to work offline forever, but to upgrade when connecting to the Internet

# Possible solutions

## Don't check Valid-Until on installation

Disable release file validity test on installation (Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false). We could test if we are offline before doing that. We would still do the validity check on upgrade.

## Local repository

Use a local repository to store the packages (e.g. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal). We control our Release file, but importing and upgrading the repository looks annoying.
