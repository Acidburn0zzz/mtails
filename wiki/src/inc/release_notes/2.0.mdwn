## New features

- Tails now uses the <span class="application">GNOME Shell</span> desktop
  environment, in its <span class="application">Classic</span> mode.
  <span class="application">GNOME Shell</span> provides a modern, simple, and
  actively developed desktop environment. The <span class="application">Classic
  mode brings back the traditional <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>,
  <span class="guimenu">Places</span> menu, and windows list. Accessibility and
  non-Latin input sources are also better integrated.
