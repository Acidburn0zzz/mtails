## New features

- Tails now uses the <span class="application">GNOME Shell</span> desktop
  environment, in its <span class="application">Classic</span> mode.
  <span class="application">GNOME Shell</span> provides a modern, simple, and
  actively developed desktop environment. The <span class="application">Classic
  mode brings back the traditional <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>,
  <span class="guimenu">Places</span> menu, and windows list. Accessibility and
  non-Latin input sources are also better integrated.

  Work is in progress to [[!tails_ticket 10830 desc="add it back"]] but [[your
  help is needed|news/windows_camouflage_jessie]]!

- Change to `systemd` as init system and use it to:
  - Sandbox many services using Linux namespaces and make them harder to exploit.
  - Make the starting of Tor and the memory wipe on shutdown more robust.
  - Sanitize our code base by replacing many custom scripts.

- Update most firmware packages which might improve hardware compatibility.
