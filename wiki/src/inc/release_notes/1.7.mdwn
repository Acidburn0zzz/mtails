## New features

- You can now start Tails in [[offline mode|doc/first_steps/startup_options/offline_mode]]
  to disable all networking for additional security. Doing so can be
  useful to work on sensitive documents.

- Added <span class="application">[[Icedove|doc/anonymous_internet/icedove]]</span>,
  a rebranded version of <span class="application">Mozilla
  Thunderbird</span>.

  This is currently a technology preview. Icedove is safe to use in the
  context of Tails but it will be better integrated in future versions
  until we remove <span class="application">[[Claws
  Mail|claws_mail]]</span>. Users of <span class="application">Claws
  Mail</span> should refer to our instructions to [[migrate their data from
  <span class="application">Claws Mail</span> to
  <span class="application">Icedove</span>|doc/anonymous_internet/claws_mail_to_icedove]].
