There are numerous other changes that might not be apparent in the daily
operation of a typical user. Technical details of all the changes

## Fixed problems

  - Fix several issues related to *MAC address spoofing*:
    * If MAC address spoofing fails for some network interface *and*
      it cannot be disabled afterwards, networking should now be
      completely disabled.
    * If MAC address spoofing causes network issues (e.g. due to the
      access point blocking all but whitelisted MAC addresses) a
      notification should now be properly displayed.
