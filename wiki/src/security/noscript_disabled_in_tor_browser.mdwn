<div class="caution">Tor Browser in Tails 3.13.1 is not safe to use
without taking the manual steps listed below each time you start
Tails!</div>

Due to [a mistake in Mozilla's signing
infrastructure](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1548973)
all Firefox and Tor Browser add-ons are currently disabled, which
disables important protections (the NoScript add-on) for Tails users.

To secure your Tor Browser you must follow these steps each time you
start Tails 3.13.1:

  1. Open the address `about:config` in the Tor Browser address bar
  2. Click the "I accept the risk!" button
  3. At the top of the page, search for
     `xpinstall.signatures.required`
  4. Set the `xpinstall.signatures.required` entry to **false** by
     double clicking it

To the right of the address bar an icon with a blue S (and possibly a
red question mark or other variations) should appear, and this
indicates that your browser is safe again.
