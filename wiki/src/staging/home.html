<h1>Tails is a portable operating system that protects your privacy and avoids
censorship.</h1>

<h2>Start any computer on your Tails USB stick instead of starting on Windows
or macOS.</h2>

<!--
P3: Portable OS: something like iOS, Android? != mobile. Add "for laptops" somewhere
  - XXX: Have a hero image with a computer?
P4: Does Tails sell the USB stick? Can I use any USB stick?
P5: Can you run your own software on this USB stick?
P5: Is it like Ubuntu?

P1: [DONE] Install Tails on a USB stick and run it on any computer instead of STARTING ON Windows or macOS
P5: [DONE] "Instead of Win/mac" [had to be read twice, sentence structure] reads to them like Tails **only** works with Linux

<h3>Avoid surveillance, censorship, advertising, and viruses</h3>

<p>Tails uses the Tor network to protect your privacy online and avoid
censorship. Enjoy the Internet like it should be.</p>

<!--
P4: What does "No ads" mean? Will news websites start blocking me [ad-blockers]?
P5: *No ads, no viruses* HOW? And is it because there's nothing important of the laptop, so there is no value for hackers?

P2: [DONE] No virus: "because it's Linux"

<h3>Your secure computer anywhere</h3>

<p>To use Tails, shutdown the computer and start on your Tails USB
stick. Tails leaves no trace on the computer when shutting down.</p>

<!--
P4: [WORK] AMAZING that I can use someone else's computer without compromising on security!
P5: [DONE] "Turn your own computer into a secure machine" [had to be read 3-4 times for understanding]. Is it like Vine?
P6: [DONE] Thinks that the image means that your computer can be safe even in a camping

<h3>Digital security toolbox</h3>

<p>Tails includes tools to work on sensitive documents and communicate
securely. Everything in Tails is ready-to-use and secure by default.</p>

<!--
P4: [DONE] *Toolbox* - can I access Google Docs? What are these tools?
P5: [DONE] *Toolbox* is this software written by Tails? Someone else? Who chose what to include, is it trustworthy?
P2: [DONE] "Which tools?"

<h3>Free Software</h3>

<p>You can download Tails for free and security researchers can verify our
work. Tails is based on Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

<!--
P4: The free software box is also slightly repetitive; maybe just add "free software" to the first sentence?

P5: [DONE] Who are independent researchers? Does it just mean everyone/all developers?
