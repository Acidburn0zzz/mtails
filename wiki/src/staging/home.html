<h2>Start any computer from your Tails USB stick instead of starting on Windows
or macOS.</h2>

<!--
P3: Portable OS: something like iOS, Android? != mobile. Add "for laptops" somewhere
  - XXX: Have a hero image with a computer?
P4: Does Tails sell the USB stick? Can I use any USB stick?
P5: Can you run your own software on this USB stick?
P5: Is it like Ubuntu?

P1: [DONE] Install Tails on a USB stick and run it on any computer instead of STARTING ON Windows or macOS
P5: [DONE] "Instead of Win/mac" [had to be read twice, sentence structure] reads to them like Tails **only** works with Linux

<h3>Your secure computer anywhere</h3>

<p>Start any computer from your Tails USB stick to turn it into a secure
machine, even somebody else's computer.</p>

<!--
P5: "Run it on someone else's device" are they logged out? will they lose data when I plug it in?

P4: [WORK] AMAZING that I can use someone else's computer without compromising on security!
P5: [DONE] "Turn your own computer into a secure machine" [had to be read 3-4 times for understanding]. Is it like Vine?

<h3>Avoid surveillance and censorship</h3>

<p>Tails uses the Tor network to protect your privacy online and avoid
censorship.</p>

<!--
P3: "safe"? how safe eg. how different from anonymous browsing mode?
P5: *Tor* if everything is Tor, that could be hard. For example, Wikipedia blocks edits from Tor. And there are other services you can't use.

P3: [DONE] Tor is prestigous

<h3>No advertising, no viruses, no tracking</h3>

<p>Enjoy the Internet like it should be.</p>

<!--
P4: What does "No ads" mean? Will news websites start blocking me [ad-blockers]?
P5: *No ads, no viruses* HOW? And is it because there's nothing important of the laptop, so there is no value for hackers?

P2: [DONE] No virus: "because it's Linux"

<h3>Digital security toolbox</h3>

<p>Tails includes a selection of tools to work on sensitive documents and communicate
securely.</p>

<!--
P4: [DONE] *Toolbox* - can I access Google Docs? What are these tools?
P5: [DONE] *Toolbox* is this software written by Tails? Someone else? Who chose what to include, is it trustworthy?
P2: [DONE] "Which tools?"
-->

<h3>Secure by default</h3>

<p>Tails and all its tools are configured with security in mind to make them
easy to use and prevent mistakes.</p>

<!--
P2: "How can I know that it is really so secure?"
P4: "Secure by default" doesn't give additional info, it's repeating what I already know re censorship/surveillance.
P5: "Secure by default" what does that mean?? What are "mistakes"?

<h3>Free Software</h3>

<p>You can download Tails for free and security researchers can verify our
work. Tails is based on Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

<!--
P4: The free software box is also slightly repetitive; maybe just add "free software" to the first sentence?

P5: [DONE] Who are independent researchers? Does it just mean everyone/all developers?
