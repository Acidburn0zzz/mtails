  <h2>Your secure computer anywhere</h2>

  <p class="big">To use Tails, shutdown the computer and start on your Tails USB stick
  instead of starting on Windows or macOS.</p>

  <p class="big">You can temporarily <strong>turn you own
  computer into a secure machine</strong>. You can also <strong>stay
  safe while using the computer of somebody else</strong>.

  <p class="medium">You don't have to worry about the computer having viruses
  because Tails runs independently from Windows and never uses the hard disk.
  You can start again on the other operating system after you shut down
  Tails.</p>

  <p class="medium">Tails takes
  [[!inline pages="inc/stable_amd64_iso_size" raw="yes" sort="age"]]
  to download, Â½ hour to install, any USB stick of 8 GB minimum, and
  works on most computers less than 10 years old.</p>

  <p class="medium">Still, Tails cannot always protect you if you
  install it from a computer with viruses or if you use it on a computer
  with malicious hardware, like keyloggers.</p>

<!--
P3: What would be the "insecure" of macOS?  I feel like Mac protects privacy Why should I bother? Is this really better?
P3: Maybe I don't have install rights on Windows
P4: Also... some USB sticks have viruses on them. Will Tails tell me if the USB stick is okay before I install?

P3: [DONE] The installation of an OS takes several hours / minutes
P5: [DONE] "Instead of Win/mac" [had to be read twice, sentence structure] reads to them like Tails **only** works with Linux

  <h2>Amnesia</h2>

  <p class="big">Tails always starts from the same clean state and <strong>everything you
  do disappears</strong> automatically when you shut down Tails.</p>

  computer:</p>

  <ul class="medium">
    <li>Websites that you visited, even in private mode</li>
    <li>Files that you opened, even if you deleted them</li>
    <li>Passwords, even if you use a password manager</li>
    <li>All the devices and Wi-Fi networks that you used</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="medium">On the contrary, Tails never writes anything to the hard
  disk and only runs from the memory of the computer. The memory is entirely
  deleted when you shutdown Tails, erasing all possible traces.</p>

  <h1>Leave no trace on the Internet</h1>

</div>

<div class="row">

  <div class="col-md-7">

  <h2>Tor for everything</h2>

  <p class="big">Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor
  network. Tor encrypts and anonymizes your connection by
  <strong>passing it through 3 relays</strong>. <i>Relays</i> are servers
  operated by different people and organizations around the world.</p>

  <p class="medium">This way, a single relay never knows both where the encrypted
  connection is coming from and where it is going to. Tor is <strong>secure
  by design</strong> even if a few relays are malicious:</p>

  <ul class="medium">
    <li>The 1st relay only knows where you are coming from but not where
    you are going to.</li>
    <li>This 3rd relay only knows where you are going to but not where
    you are coming from.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="medium">Tor has more than 6&#8239;000 relays. Organizations running Tor relays
  include universities like the MIT, activist groups like Riseup,
  nonprofits like Derechos Digitales, Internet hosting companies like
  Private Internet Access, etc. The huge diversity of people and
  organizations running Tor relays make it more secure and more
  sustainable.</p>

  <h2>Avoid online surveillance and censorship</h2>

  <p class="big">Tor prevents someone watching your Internet connection from learning
  <strong><i>what</i> you are doing on the Internet</strong>. You can avoid
  censorship because it is <strong>impossible for a censor to know</strong> which
  sites you are visiting.</p>

  <p class="medium">If connecting to Tor is blocked or dangerous to use from where you
  are, for example Iran or China, you can use <i>bridges</i> to connect to
  Tor in a more discrete way. Different types of bridges work better in
  different places.</p>

  <h2>Avoid tracking and change identity</h2>

  <p class="big">Tor also prevents the websites that you are visiting from learning
  <strong><i>where</i> and <i>who</i> you are</strong>, unless you tell them. You
  can visit websites <strong>anonymously or change your identity</strong>. Online
  trackers won't be able to follow you around from one site to another
  anymore.</p>

  <p class="medium">You can publish a blog or manage a social media
  account entirely from Tails. If you only access it from
  Tails, it cannot be related to you. You can store documents
  and images related to this different identity in your Persistence,
  keep your passwords in <i>KeePassXC</i>, have a dedicated
  email account in <i>Thunderbird</i>, etc.</p>
