  <h2>Your secure computer anywhere</h2>

  <p>Tails is installed on a USB stick that you can run on any computer
  instead of Windows or macOS. You can temporarily <em>turn you own
  computer into a secure machine</em> without modifying it or <em>stay
  safe while using someone else's computer</em>. You don't have to
  worry about the viruses on your Windows.</p>

  <p>Tails takes
  [[!inline pages="inc/stable_amd64_iso_size" raw="yes" sort="age"]]
  to download, Â½ hour to install, and a USB stick of 8 GB minimum.</p>

  <!-- PIC: Tails is like a tent. You can carry it with you and use it
  anywhere! -->

  <div class="col-md-7">

  <h2>Amnesia</h2>

  <p>Tails always starts from the same clean state and <em>everything you
  did disappears</em> automatically when you shut down Tails.

  <p>Usually, almost everything you do leaves traces on the computer:
  the websites that you visited (even in private mode!), the files that
  you downloaded (even if you deleted them!), your passwords (even if
  you use a password manager!), all the devices and Wi-Fi networks that
  you used, etc.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Tails only runs from the memory of the computer,
  without ever writing anything to the hard disk. The memory is entirely
  deleted when you shutdown Tails, erasing all possible traces.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- PIC: Like a tent, Tails starts empty every time and leaves no
  trace when you shut it down. -->

  <h2>Encrypted Persistence</h2>

  <p>You can choose to <em>save some of your files and configuration</em>
  in an encrypted Persistence, protected by a password. You can store in
  Persistence your documents, your browser bookmarks, your emails, and
  even some additional software.</p>

  <!-- PIC: You can carry your personal things in your secure backpack and
  set them up if your tent if you want to. -->

  <h2>Digital security toolbox</h2>

  <p>Tails includes many applications to <em>work on sensitive documents
  and communicate securely</em>:

  <ul>
    <li>*Tor Browser* with *uBlock*, an anonymous web browser and an ad-blocker</li>
    <li>*Thunderbird* with *Enigmail*, an email application and a PGP extension</li>
    <li>*KeePassXC*, a password manager</li>
    <li>*LibreOffice*, an office suite</li>
    <li>*OnionShare*, to share files over Tor</li>
    <li>and many more!</li>
  </ul>

  All the applications included in Tails
  are ready-to-use and configured with safe defaults to <em>prevent
  mistakes</em>.</p>

  <!-- PIC: Camping gear -->

  <!-- MORE:
  Tails also comes with a selection of tools to protect your data using strong
  encryption:

    - [[Encrypt your USB sticks or external
      hard-disks|doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]] using <span
      class="definition">[[!wikipedia Linux_Unified_Key_Setup desc="LUKS"]]</span>,
      the Linux standard for disk-encryption.

    - Automatically use HTTPS to encrypt all your communications to a number of
      major websites using [HTTPS
      Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), a Firefox extension
      developed by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org).

    - Encrypt and sign your emails and documents using the *de facto* standard
      <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP desc="OpenPGP"]]</span>
      either from Tails email client, text editor or file browser.

    - Protect your instant messaging conversations using <span
      class="definition">[[!wikipedia Off-the-Record_Messaging
      desc="OTR"]]</span>, a cryptographic tool that provides encryption,
      authentication and deniability.

    - [[Securely delete your files|doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]]
      and clean your diskspace using [[Nautilus
      Wipe|http://wipetools.tuxfamily.org/nautilus-wipe.html]].

  <h2>Tor for everything</h2>

  <p>Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor
  network. Tor encrypts and anonymizes your connection by
  passing it through <em>3 relays around the
  world</em> operated by many different people and organizations.</p>

  <p>This way, a single relay never knows both where the encrypted
  connection is coming from and where it is going to. Tor is <em>secure
  by design</em> even if a few relays were malicious:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The 1st relay only knows where you are coming from but not where
    you are going to.</li>
    <li>This 3rd relay only knows where you are going to but not where
    you are coming from.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Tor has more than 6000 relays. Organizations running Tor relays
  include universities like the MIT, activist groups like Riseup,
  non-profit like Derechos Digitales, Internet hosting companies like
  Private Internet Access, etc. The huge diversity of people and
  organizations running Tor relays make it more secure and more
  sustainable.</p>

  <!-- PIC: Map with secret path -->

  <!-- XXX:
    - all software is configured to connect to the Internet through Tor
    - if an application tries to connect to the Internet directly, the
      connection is automatically blocked for security.

  <h2>Avoid online surveillance and censorship</h2>

  <p>Tor prevents someone watching your Internet connection from learning
  <em><i>what</i> you are doing on the Internet</em>. You can avoid
  censorship because it is <em>impossible for a censor to know</em> which
  sites you are visiting.</p>

  <p>If connecting to Tor is blocked or dangerous to use from where you
  are, for example Iran or China, you can use *bridges* to connect to
  Tor in a more discrete way. Different types of bridges work better in
  different places.</p>

  </div>

</div>

<div class="row follow">

  <div class="col-md-7">

  <h2>Change identity and avoid tracking</h2>

  <p>Tor also prevents the websites that you are visiting from learning
  <em><i>where</i> and <i>who</i> you are</em>, unless you tell them. You
  can visit websites <em>anonymously or change your identity</em>. Online
  trackers won't be able to follow you around from one site to another
  anymore.</p>

  <p>For example, using Tails you can manage securely a social media
  account with a different name. If you only access this account from
  Tails, it is impossible to relate it to you. You can store documents
  and images related to this different identity in your Persistence,
  keep your passwords for this account in *KeePassXC*, have a dedicated
  email account in *Thunderbird*, etc.</p>

  <h2>Security that comes for free</h2>

  <p>Because nobody should have to pay to be safe while using a computer,
  we are giving out Tails for free and try to make it easy to use by
  anybody. We are a nonprofit and diverse community. Our work is funded
  by donations from people like you and organizations that support
  Internet freedom.</p>

  <p>For example, the following organizations have supported Tails
  financially in the past: Mozilla, Tor, DuckDuckGo, Freedom of the
  Press Foundation, and AccessNow.</p>

  <h2>Transparency to build trust</h2>

  <p>Our work and all the code of our software is public so that you don't
  have to trust us blindly. Independent security researchers can verify
  that Tails really works the way it should.

  <h2>Sharing</h2>

  <p>Tails is built on solid foundations: the Tor
  network, the Debian operating system, and the GNOME desktop environment.
  We share back our improvements with these projects and others whenever
  possible so that many more people can benefit from our work.</p>
