Tails is a non-profit organization whose mission is to empower people
worldwide by giving out an operating system that protects from
surveillance and censorship.

We make digital security tools accessible to everyone, whenever they
need it: activists, journalists, freedom fighters, and ultimately, you,
whenever you need some extra privacy in this digital world.
