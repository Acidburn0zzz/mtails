[[Back|install/debian]]

1. Download the ISO image:

   <p class="pre">wget --continue [[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_iso_url" raw="yes"]]</p>

1. Import the Tails signing key in your <span class="application">GnuPG</span> keyring:

       wget https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key

       gpg --import < tails-signing.key

1. Install the Debian keyring. It contains the OpenPGP keys of all Debian developers:

       sudo apt-get install debian-keyring/jessie

1. Import the OpenPGP key of [[!wikipedia Stefano_Zacchiroli]], a former Debian Project Leader, from the Debian keyring into your keyring:

       gpg --keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --export zack@upsilon.cc | gpg --import

1. Verify the certifications made on the Tails signing key:

       gpg --check-sigs A490D0F4D311A4153E2BB7CADBB802B258ACD84F

   In the output of this command, look for the following line:

       sig! 0x9C31503C6D866396 2015-02-03  Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@upsilon.cc>

   Here, <code>sig!</code>, with an exclamation mark, means that Stefano
   Zacchiroli verified and certified the Tails signing key with his key.

1. Certify the Tails signing key with your own key:

       gpg --sign-key A490D0F4D311A4153E2BB7CADBB802B258ACD84F

1. Verify that the ISO image is signed by the Tails signing key:

   <p class="pre">[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_gpg_verify" raw="yes"]]</p>

   The output of this command should be the following:

   <p class="pre">[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_gpg_signature_output" raw="yes"]]</p>

   Verify in this output that:

     - The date of the signature is the same.
     - The signature is marked as <code>Good signature</code> since you
       certified the Tails signing key with your own key.
