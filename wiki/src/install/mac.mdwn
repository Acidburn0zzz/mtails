Tails is not working on every Mac model and you might have to try **different
installation methods**.

At the end, maybe:

  - It will be **impossible** to start Tails on your Mac.
  - You will **start on a full-feature Tails**.
  - You will **start on a minimal Tails** with no automatic upgrades and
    persistent storage.
  - You will start Tails with **Wi-Fi o graphics problems**.

Anyway, ready to give it a try?

  - [[Try cloning from another Tails|mac/clone]]

    If you know someone of trust who uses Tails already, you can try installing
    your USB stick by copying from it. Make sure that this Tails is up-to-date.

  - If you don't know anyone who uses Tails or if you tried to clone and
    failed starting, then you can try these other three methods:

    - [[Install from another operating system|os]]

      The easiest might be to install Tails from a Windows or Linux computer.

    - [[Burn a DVD and then install|mac/dvd]]

    - [[Install using the command line|mac/usb]]

You can also:

  - [[Run Tails in a virtual machine|mac/vm]]
