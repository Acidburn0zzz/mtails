Tails is not working on every Mac model and you might have to try **different
installation methods**.

At the end, maybe:

  - It will be **impossible** to start Tails on your Mac.
  - You will **start on a full-feature Tails**.
  - You will **start on a minimal Tails** with no automatic upgrades and
    persistent storage.
  - You will start Tails with **Wi-Fi o graphics problems**.

Anyway, ready to give it a try?

  - Try cloning from another Tails

    If you know someone of trust who uses Tails already, you can try installing
    your USB stick by copying from it.

  - If you don't know anyone who uses Tails or if you tried to clone and
    failed starting, then you can try this other 3 methods:

    - Install from another operating system

      The easiest might be to install Tails from a Windows or Linux computer.

    - Burn a DVD

    - Install using the command line
