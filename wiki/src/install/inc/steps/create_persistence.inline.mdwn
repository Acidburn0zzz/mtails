Create an encrypted persistent storage (optional)
=================================================

<div class="step-image">[[!img install/inc/infography/create-persistence.png link="no"]]</div>

You can optionally create an *encrypted persistent storage* in the
remaining free space on the
<span class="windows linux mac-usb">final</span>
<span class="clone">new</span>
Tails USB stick to store any of the following:

  - Your personal files and working documents
  - Some of your settings
  - Your encryption keys

The data in the encrypted persistent storage:

  - Remains available across separate working sessions.
  - Is encrypted using a passphrase of your choice.

Once the encrypted persistent storage is created, you can choose whether
to activate it or not each time you start Tails.

<div class="caution">

<p>The encrypted persistent storage is not hidden. An attacker in possession of
the USB stick can know whether it has an encrypted persistent storage. Take into consideration
that you can be forced or tricked to give out its passphrase.</p>

</div>

<div class="caution">

<p>It is possible to
open the encrypted persistent storage from other operating systems, but it might break
your security.
Other operating systems should probably not be trusted to handle
sensitive information or leave no trace.</p>

</div>

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent volume</span></span> to
   start the <span class="application">Persistence Assistant</span>. The assistant proposes to create
   an encrypted persistent volume on the USB stick.

1. Specify a passphrase of your choice in both the
<span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> and <span class="guilabel">Verify
Passphrase</span> text boxes. Click on the <span class="guilabel">Create</span> button.

   <div class="tip">
   <p>We recommend choosing a long passphrase made of several random words
   rather than a single password. For example, "<em>bank violin thread duck knob
   train</em>" is a very strong passphrase.</p>

   <p>To learn how to choose a good passphrase, you can read
   <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/">this
   article from <em>The Intercept</em></a>.</p>
   </div>

3. Wait for the creation to finish.

   <div class="bug">
   <p>If the creation is interrupted before it finishes, you might not
   be able to start Tails from this USB stick anymore. This can happen if you
   close the window of the assistant or unplug the USB stick during the creation of
   the encrypted persistent storage. Reinstall Tails on this USB stick to fix this issue.</p>
   </div>

4. The assistant shows a list of the possible persistence features. Each
   feature corresponds to a set of files or settings to be saved in the encrypted
   persistent storage.

   For the time being, we recommend you to only activate the
   <span class="guilabel">Personal Data</span> persistence feature. You
   can modify the configuration of the encrypted persistent storage
   later on according to your needs.

5. Click <span class="button">Save</span>.

   <div class="step-image">[[!img install/inc/infography/restart-on-tails.png link="no"]]</div>

1. Shut down the computer and restart on the
   <span class="windows linux mac-usb">final</span>
   <span class="clone">new</span>
   Tails USB stick.

1. In <span class="application">Tails Greeter</span>:

   - Select your preferred language in the drop-down list on the bottom
     left of the screen.
   - In the <span class="guilabel">Use persistence?</span> section,
     choose <span class="guilabel">Yes</span> to enable the encrypted
     persistent storage for the current working session.
   - Enter the passphrase of the persistent volume in the
     <span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> text box.</span>
   - If you select the <span class="guilabel">Read-Only</span>, your
     changes are not saved.
   - Click <span class="button">Login</span>.

   <div class="caution">
   <p>Use the encrypted persistent storage only when necessary. You can
   always start Tails without activating the encrypted persistent
   storage.</p>
   </div>

1. After 15&ndash;30 seconds, the Tails desktop appears.

1. You can now save your personal files and working documents in the
<span class="guilabel">Persistent</span> folder. To open the
<span class="guilabel">Persistent</span> folder choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Places</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Persistent</span></span>.
