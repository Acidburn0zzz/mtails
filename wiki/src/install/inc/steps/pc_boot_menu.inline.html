<h2>Troubleshooting: Tails does not start at all</h2>

<p>The following section applies if the <span class="application">Boot Loader Menu</span>
   does not appear when starting on a USB stick.</p>

<p>It is quite common for computers not to start automatically on a
   USB stick with Tails installed. Here are some troubleshooting techniques. You should try them
   one after the other.</p>

<h3>Getting to the boot menu</h3>

<p>On most computers, you can press a *boot menu key* to display a list of
   possible devices to start from. The following instructions explain how
   to display the boot menu and start on the USB stick. The following
   screenshot is an example of such boot menu:</p>

<p>[[!img install/inc/screenshots/bios_boot_menu.png link="no" alt=""]]</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Shut down the computer.</p></li>

  <li><p>Make sure that the first USB stick is plugged in the computer.</p></li>

  <li>
    <p>Identify the potential boot menu keys for the computer depending on
    the computer manufacturer in the following list:</p>

      <table>
        <tr><th>Manufacturer</th><th>Key</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Acer</td><td>Esc, F12, F9</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Asus</td><td>Esc, F8</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Dell</td><td>F12</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fujitsu</td><td>F12, Esc</td></tr>
        <tr><td>HP</td><td>Esc, F9</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Lenovo</td><td>F12, Novo, F8, F10</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Samsung</td><td>Esc, F12, F2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Sony</td><td>F11, Esc, F10</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Toshiba</td><td>F12</td></tr>
        <tr><td>others&hellip;</td><td>F12, Esc</td></tr>
      </table>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Switch on the computer.</p>

    <p>Immediately press several times the first potential boot menu key
    identified in step 3.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If a boot menu with a list of devices appears, select your USB stick
      and press <span class="keycap">Enter</span>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If the computer starts on another operating system, then:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><p>Shut down the computer.</p></li>

          <li><p>Press-and-hold the potential boot menu key identified in step 3.</p></li>

          <li><p>Switch on the computer again while holding the potential boot menu key pressed.</p>

            <ul>
              <p>If a boot menu with a list of devices appears, select your USB stick
               and press <span class="keycap">Enter</span>.</p>

              <p>If the computer starts on another operating system or returns an
               error message, then shut down the computer again and repeat step
               4 for all the potential boot menu keys identified in step 3.</p>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If none of the potential boot menu keys identified in step 3 work or if
    the USB stick does not appear in the list, then try the second
    troubleshooting technique described below.</p>
  </li>

</ol>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Disable <strong>Fast boot</strong>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If the computer is configured to start with <strong>legacy BIOS</strong>, try to
