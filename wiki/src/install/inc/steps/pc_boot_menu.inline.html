<h2>Make the computer start on the USB stick</h2>

<p>This step is the most complicated one as it depends a lot on the
model of the computer:</p>

<ul>
<li>On most computers, our basic instructions to get to the boot menu
work fine.</li>
<li>On some computers, you might have to do more advanced techniques,
like editing the BIOS settings.</li>
<li>On few computers, it might currently be impossible to start Tails
but it's very hard to know without trying.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to reach the <span class="application">Boot Loader
Menu</span> of Tails:</p>

<p>[[!img install/inc/screenshots/boot_loader_menu.png link="no" alt="Black screen with Tails artwork. Boot Loader Menu with two options 'Tails' and 'Tails (Troubleshooting Mode)'."]]</p>

<div class="next">

<p>After you reached the <span class="application">Boot Loader Menu</span>, you
can skip the rest of this section and <a href="#greeter">wait until
<span class="application">Tails Greeter</span> appears</a>.</p>

</div>

<h3>Getting to the boot menu</h3>

<p>On most computers, you can press a <em>boot menu key</em> to display
a list of possible devices to start from. The following instructions
explain how to display the boot menu and start on the USB stick. The
following screenshot is an example of such boot menu:</p>

<p>[[!img install/inc/screenshots/bios_boot_menu.png link="no" alt=""]]</p>

<ol>

<li>
  <p class="usb">Shut down the computer while leaving the USB stick plugged in.</p>
  <p class="clone upgrade-tails">Shut down the computer.</p>
  <p class="clone">Plug in the other Tails USB stick that you want to
  <span class="install-clone">install</span>
  <span class="upgrade">upgrade</span>
  from.</p>
  <p class="upgrade-tails">Unplug your Tails USB stick while leaving the intermediary USB stick plugged in.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Identify the potential boot menu keys for the computer depending on
  the computer manufacturer in the following list:</p>

  <table>
    <tr><th>Manufacturer</th><th>Key</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Acer</td><td>Esc, F12, F9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Asus</td><td>Esc, F8</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dell</td><td>F12</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fujitsu</td><td>F12, Esc</td></tr>
    <tr><td>HP</td><td>Esc, F9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lenovo</td><td>F12, Novo, F8, F10</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Samsung</td><td>Esc, F12, F2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sony</td><td>F11, Esc, F10</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Toshiba</td><td>F12</td></tr>
    <tr><td>others&hellip;</td><td>F12, Esc</td></tr>
  </table>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Switch on the computer.</p>

  <p>Immediately press several times the first potential boot menu key
  identified in step 2.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If a boot menu with a list of devices appears, select your USB stick
     and press <span class="keycap">Enter</span>.</li>

    <li>If the computer starts on another operating system or returns an
     error message, then shut down the computer again and repeat step
     3 for all the potential boot menu keys identified in step 2.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If none of the potential boot menu keys identified in step 2 work or if
  the USB stick does not appear in the list, then try the second
  troubleshooting technique described below.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Edit the BIOS settings</h3>

<p>You might need to edit the BIOS settings of the computer.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p>Search for the user manual of the computer on the website of its
manufacturer to learn how to edit the BIOS settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers">Acer</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.asus.com/us/support/">Asus</a></li>

<p>In the BIOS settings, try to apply the following changes one by one and
restart the computer after each change. Some changes might not
apply to certain computer models.</p>

<div class="caution">
<p>Take note of the changes that you apply to the BIOS settings, to be
able to revert them if they prevent the computer to start on its usual
operating system.</p>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>
   <p>Edit the <strong>Boot Order</strong>. Depending on the computer model you might
   see an entry for <strong>removable devices</strong> or <strong>USB media</strong>. Move this entry
   to the top of the list to force the computer to try to start from
   the first USB stick before starting from the internal hard disk.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Disable <strong>Fast boot</strong>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If the computer is configured to start with <strong>legacy BIOS</strong>, try to
   configure it to start with <strong>UEFI</strong>. Else, if the computer is configured
   to start with <strong>UEFI</strong>, try to configure it to start with <strong>legacy
   BIOS</strong>. To do so, try any of the following options if available:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enable <strong>Legacy mode</strong></li>
      <li>Disable <strong>Secure boot</strong>
         (see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/disabling-secure-boot">Microsoft documentation</a>)</li>
      <li>Enable <strong>CSM boot</strong></li>
      <li>Disable <strong>UEFI</strong></li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><p>Try to upgrade the BIOS to the latest version provided by the manufacturer.</p></li>
</ol>
