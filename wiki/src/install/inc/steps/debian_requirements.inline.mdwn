These instructions require:

  - Debian 9 (Stretch) or later
  - Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) or later
  - Linux Mint 18 (Sarah) or later

If your version of Debian, Ubuntu, or Linux Mint is not supported, you can follow the
instructions for [[other Linux distributions|install/linux/usb-overview]]
instead. But they are more complicated and require two USB sticks instead of
one.

<p>To know your version of Debian, Ubuntu, or Linux Mint, execute:</p>

<pre><code>lsb_release -a</code></pre>
