This scenario requires:

  - Debian 8 (Jessie) or later
  - Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily) or later

<div class="tip debian">

<p>To know your version of Debian or Ubuntu, open
<span class="application">System Settings</span> and click on
<span class="guilabel">Details</span>. For Debian, refer to the
<span class="guilabel">Base system</span> information.</p>

</div>

<div class="tip expert">

<p>To know your version of Ubuntu, execute
<span class="command">lsb_release -a</span>.</p>

</div>

If your version of Debian or Ubuntu is not supported, you can follow the
scenario for [[other Linux distributions|install/linux/usb/overview]]
instead. But it is more complicated and requires two USB sticks instead of
one.
