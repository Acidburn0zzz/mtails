Verify that the other Tails is up-to-date
=========================================

To prevent installing an outdated version of Tails with known security
issues, make sure that the Tails you are installing from is up-to-date:

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">About Tails</span></span>.

1. Verify that you are running
   <span class="guilabel">Tails [[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_version" raw="yes"]]</span>
   which is the latest version.

1. If you are not running the latest version, connect to the Internet
   and wait until Tor is ready. After a minute or two, *Tails Upgrader*
   appears with instructions on how to upgrade.

   Apply all upgrades as suggested.
