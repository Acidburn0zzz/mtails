Verify that the other TⒶILS is up-to-date
=========================================

To prevent
<span class="install-clone mac-clone">installing</span>
<span class="upgrade-clone">upgrading to</span>
an outdated version of TⒶILS with known security issues, make sure that the TⒶILS you are
<span class="install-clone mac-clone">installing</span>
<span class="upgrade-clone">upgrading</span>
from is up-to-date:

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">TⒶILS</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">About TⒶILS</span></span>.

1. Verify that you are running
   <span class="guilabel">TⒶILS [[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_version" raw="yes"]]</span>
   released on [[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_date" raw="yes"]]:

   a. If you are running [[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_version" raw="yes"]] then you can continue with the next step.

   b. If you are not running [[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_version" raw="yes"]] then connect to the Internet
   and wait until Tor is ready. After a minute or two, <span class="application">TⒶILS Upgrader</span>
   appears with instructions on how to upgrade. Apply all upgrades as requested.

      <div class="bug">
      <p>If at some point it is impossible to do automatic upgrades, then
      we recommend you
      <span class="install-clone">[[choose a different installation method|install/os]].</span>
      <span class="mac-clone">[[choose a different installation method|install/mac]].</span>
      <span class="upgrade-clone">[[upgrade from TⒶILS instead|upgrade/tails]].</span>
      </div>
