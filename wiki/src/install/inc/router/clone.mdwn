Install from another Tails

If you know someone of trust who uses Tails already, then the easiest
is to install your Tails by copying from it. Make sure that this
Tails is up-to-date.

You need:

  - 1 friend with Tails
  - 1 flash memory (USB stick or SD card of at least 4 GB)
  - 15 minutes to install
