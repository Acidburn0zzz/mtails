[[!meta title="Download and verify using OpenPGP"]]

These instructions are for people who are already familiar with basic
usage of OpenPGP and have *GPG* installed but might need guidance on
performing the verification.

1. Download the latest [Tails ISO image](https://tails.boum.org/torrents/files/latest.iso)
   (<span class="remove-extra-space">[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_iso_size" raw="yes"]]</span>).

1. Download the [OpenPGP signature](https://tails.boum.org/torrents/files/latest.iso.sig)
   of the latest Tails ISO image and save it to the same folder where
   you saved the ISO image.

1. If you are doing the verification for the first time, download the
   [[Tails signing key|tails-signing.key]] and import it in your keyring.
   If you are working from Tails, the signing key is already included.

   All our ISO images are signed with the same signing key, so you only
   have to import it once. Still, you have to verify the ISO image every
   time you download a new one.
