"After [SHAttered](http://shattered.io/) demonstrated that finding SHA-1 "
"collisions is feasible for resourceful adversaries, and [BitErrant](https://"
"biterrant.io/) exploited this for generating the same `.torrent` file from "
"distinct data, we consider BitTorrent's data authenticity completely broken; "
"authenticated `.torrent` files cannot be trusted to download the intended "
"data! Adversial peers in the BitTorrent swarm can spread a corrupted first "
"chunk (but with same SHA-1) making Tails unbootable, effectively DoSing the "
"Tails users that happen to fetch the chunk from those peers. Worse, with "
"some more work they could probably introduce backdoors or disable some of "
"Tails' defenses in ways that are unlikely for users to notice."
