[[!meta title="Sorry, we do not provide Torrent files any longer"]]

Sorry, we do not provide Torrent files because we have reasons to
believe BitTorrent is not a safe way to download Tails with any
longer. Please click your browser's **Back** button and select another
method to download Tails!

## For experts: Torrents considered harmful?

After [SHAttered](http://shattered.io/) demonstrated that finding
SHA-1 collisions is feasible for resourceful adversaries, and
[BitErrant](https://biterrant.io/) exploited this for generating the
same `.torrent` file from distinct data, we consider BitTorrent's data
authenticity completely broken; authenticated `.torrent` files cannot
be trusted to download the intended data! Adversial peers in the
BitTorrent swarm can spread a corrupted first chunk (but with same
SHA-1) making Tails unbootable, effectively DoSing the Tails users
that happen to fetch the chunk from those peers. Worse, with some more
work they could probably introduce backdoors or disable some of Tails'
defenses in ways that are unlikely for users to notice.

If you think we are incorrect and have proof that BitTorrent is still
safe to use for downloading and authenticating data, which would be
great news, please [[let us know|about/contact]] (or comment on
[[!tails_ticket 12456 desc="the corresponding ticket"]])!
